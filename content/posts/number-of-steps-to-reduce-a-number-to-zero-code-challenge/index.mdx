### Problem

Given an integer `num`, return the number of steps to reduce it to zero.

In one step, if the current number is even, you have to divide it by `2`, otherwise, you have to subtract `1` from it.

### Example

```
Input: num = 14
Output: 6
Explanation:
Step 1) 14 is even; divide by 2 and obtain 7.
Step 2) 7 is odd; subtract 1 and obtain 6.
Step 3) 6 is even; divide by 2 and obtain 3.
Step 4) 3 is odd; subtract 1 and obtain 2.
Step 5) 2 is even; divide by 2 and obtain 1.
Step 6) 1 is odd; subtract 1 and obtain 0.
```

### Solution

> In this given solution, I'm mutating the initial `num` as it gave me an overall better performance (runtime speed and memory usage).

We begin with null checking. We return null if the initially given number (`num`) is zero. Then we create steps variables which will hold the number of steps we took.

Then we run a while loop until the given value is zero. We check if the number is even (`num % 2`); if it is, we divide it by `2`; else, we subtract `-1` from it. During each loop, we bump the number of steps by `1`.

Then we return the `steps` value.

```js
const numberOfSteps = (num) => {
  if (num === 0) return 0;

  let steps = 0;

  while (num !== 0) {
    if (num % 2 === 0) {
      num = num / 2;
    } else {
      num--;
    }

    steps++;
  }

  return steps;
};
```
