My approach to solving [LeetCode’s Richest customer wealth](https://leetcode.com/problems/richest-customer-wealth/description/) code challenge.

---

### Problem

You are given an `m x n` integer `grid` accounts where `accounts[i][j]` is the amount of money the `i​​​​​​​​​​​th`​​​​ customer has in the `j​​​​​​​​​​​th`​​​​ bank. Return the wealth that the richest customer has.

A customer's wealth is the amount of money they have in all their bank accounts. The richest customer is the customer that has the maximum wealth.

### Example

```
Input: accounts = [[2,8,7],[7,1,3],[1,9,5]]
Output: 17
```

### Solution

This code defines a function called `maximumWealth` that takes an array of `accounts` as input. It initializes a variable called `rich` with a value of `0`. It then defines an inner function called `sumUp`, which takes an array as input and returns the sum of its elements using the reduce method.

The outer function then iterates through each element (an array) of the `accounts` array, and for each one, it calls the inner function `sumUp` to get the sum of the elements in that array. It then compares that sum to the current value of the `rich` variable. If the sum is greater than `rich`, it assigns the sum to `rich`.

Finally, the function returns the value of `rich`, representing the maximum sum of all the arrays in the `accounts` array.

```js
var maximumWealth = function (accounts) {
  let rich = 0;

  const sumUp = (arr) => arr.reduce((a, b) => a + b);

  for (let i = 0; i < accounts.length; i++) {
    if (sumUp(accounts[i]) > rich) {
      rich = sumUp(accounts[i]);
    }
  }

  return rich;
};
```
