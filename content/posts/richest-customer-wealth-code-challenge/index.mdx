My approach to solving [LeetCode’s Richest customer wealth](https://leetcode.com/problems/richest-customer-wealth/description/) code challenge.

---

### Problem

You are given an `m x n` integer `grid` accounts where `accounts[i][j]` is the amount of money the `i​​​​​​​​​​​th`​​​​ customer has in the `j​​​​​​​​​​​th`​​​​ bank. Return the wealth that the richest customer has.

A customer's wealth is the amount of money they have in all their bank accounts. The richest customer is the customer that has the maximum wealth.

### Example

```
Input: accounts = [[2,8,7],[7,1,3],[1,9,5]]
Output: 17
```

### Solution

We start by creating a new temporary array (`temp`) and populating it with the first array's element (`nums[0]`). We need to do this, as below we start for loop, where during each iteration, we will be using the last temporary array value (`temp[i - 1]`) and sum it with the current's loop value (`nums[i]`). We will push the result of this addition to the `temp` array.

Finally, we return the `temp` array.

```js
var maximumWealth = function (accounts) {
  let rich = 0;

  const sumUp = (arr) => arr.reduce((a, b) => a + b);

  for (let i = 0; i < accounts.length; i++) {
    if (sumUp(accounts[i]) > rich) {
      rich = sumUp(accounts[i]);
    }
  }

  return rich;
};
```
