There are multiple ways how to strip emoji symbols from a string in JavaScript. Yet the combination of `string.replace()`, `string.trim()` methods and `RegExp` works best in the majority of the cases.

First of all, we use `replace()` and `RegExp` to remove any emojis from the string.

At this point, you might think that’s all that we need, but practically, we still need to handle cases where there is a sequence of emojis used which creates whitespace after truncation.

Then, we use `replace()` and `RegExp` once again. This time, we are only interested to remove multiple spaces. Worth mentioning that the starting and ending spaces will be kept and stripped down to a single space.

Finally, we use `trim()` to remove any surrounding spaces from the string.

```javascript
const stripEmojis = (str) =>
  str
    .replace(
      /([\u2700-\u27BF]|[\uE000-\uF8FF]|\uD83C[\uDC00-\uDFFF]|\uD83D[\uDC00-\uDFFF]|[\u2011-\u26FF]|\uD83E[\uDD10-\uDDFF])/g,
      ''
    )
    .replace(/\s+/g, ' ')
    .trim();

console.log(stripEmojis('🎄 edvins.io'));
// Output: "edvins.io"

console.log(stripEmojis('👍 Kanye 👍 West👍 👍'));
// Output: "Kanye West"

console.log(stripEmojis('🎄a🎄b🎄c🎄d🎄e🎄f🎄g🎄h'));
// Output: "abcdefgh"

console.log(
  stripEmojis(
    "Lorem 📝Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and 📝📝📝typesetting industry.
