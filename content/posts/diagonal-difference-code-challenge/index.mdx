My approach solving [HackerRankâ€™s Diagonal Difference](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/diagonal-difference/problem) code challenge.

---

### Problem

Given a square matrix, calculate the absolute difference between the sums of its diagonals.

For example, the square matrix is shown below:

```
1 2 3
4 5 6
9 8 9
```

The left-to-right diagonal = `1 + 5 + 9 = 15`. The right to left diagonal = `3 + 5 + 9 = 17`. Their absolute difference is `|15-17| = 2`.

### Input format

The first line contains a single integer, `n`, the number of rows and columns in the square matrix `arr`.

Each of the next `n` lines describes a row, `arr[i]`, and consists of `n` space-separated integers `arr[i][j]`.

### Output format

Return the absolute difference between the sums of the matrix's two diagonals as a single integer.

### Returns

Returns `int` value of the absolute diagonal difference.

### Solution

This was a reasonably exciting challenge to solve. I've created empty arrays to store primary (`pri`) and secondary (`sec`) diagonal values.

Then I created an `arrSum` function, which we will use later, to sum up, all the array values using the `Array.reduce()` method.

Finally, here we have a `for` loop where all the fun starts to kick in. Let's return to our original example and review our two-dimensional array.

```
1 2 3
4 5 6
9 8 9
```

Following the example above, our primary diagonal will have `1 + 5 + 9`, while the secondary diagonal will be `9 + 5 + 3`. Okay, what now? We must access a 2D array - `arr[i][j]`. Where `[i]` represents the row's index, while `[j]` is the element's index within the selected row.

Below is the two-dimensional visualisation of our initial example.

```bash
[0][0] [0][1] [0][2]
[1][0] [1][1] [1][2]
[2][0] [2][1] [2][2]
```

Primary diagonal consists of 1 (`[0][0]`) + 5 (`[1][1]`) + 9 (`[2][2]`).
Secondary diagonal consists of 9 (`[2][0]`) + 5 (`[1][1]`) + 3 (`[0][2]`).

The idea is to understand the pattern. For the primary diagonal, we can see that we start at `[0][0]`, and we increment both numbers by `1` with each step.

Below is an example of our `for` loop for the primary diagonal.

```js
for (let i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
  pri.push(arr[i][i]);
}
```

For the secondary diagonal, things are a bit different. We need to descend, so we start at the last index (`arr.length - 1`). In our case, it will be `2`. Then with each iteration, we also need to subtract `- i` as we descend.

Below is an example of our `for` loop at this stage.

```js
for (let i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
  pri.push(arr[i][i]);
  sec.push(arr[arr.length - 1 - i][i]);
}
```

Now it's time to calculate sums of primary and secondary diagonal values computed using the earlier created `arrSum` function and subtract the secondary from the primary. Finally, we can return the result of the `Math.abs()` where we passed the substracted value of both arrays.

Solution complexity: `O(n)`.

```js
function diagonalDifference(arr) {
  let pri = [],
    sec = [];
  const arrSum = (arr) => arr.reduce((a, b) => a + b);

  for (let i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
    pri.push(arr[i][i]);
    sec.push(arr[arr.length - 1 - i][i]);
  }

  return Math.abs(arrSum(pri) - arrSum(sec));
}
```
