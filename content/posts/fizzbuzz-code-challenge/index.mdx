My approach to solving [LeetCodeâ€™s FizzBuzz](https://leetcode.com/problems/fizz-buzz/description/) code challenge.

---

### Problem

Given an integer `n`, return a string array `answer` (1-indexed) where:

- `answer[i] == "FizzBuzz"` if i is divisible by `3` and `5`.
- `answer[i] == "Fizz"` if `i` is divisible by `3`.
- `answer[i] == "Buzz"` if `i` is divisible by `5`.
- `answer[i] == i` (as a string) if none of the above conditions are true.

### Example

```
Input: n = 15
Output: ["1","2","Fizz","4","Buzz","Fizz","7","8","Fizz","Buzz","11","Fizz","13","14","FizzBuzz"]
```

### Solution

We start by creating a new temporary array (`temp`). Then we initialise for loop where we do have three checks to do during each iteration and push the result into the `temp` array.

- If the number is divisible by `3` and not `5`.
- If the number is divisible by `5` and not by `3`.
- If the number is divisible by `15`.
- If none of the above works, we return the current iterable and convert it as a string using the template literals.

Finally, we return the `temp` array.

```js
var fizzBuzz = function (n) {
  const temp = [];

  for (let i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
    if (i % 3 === 0 && i % 5 !== 0) {
      temp.push('Fizz');
    } else if (i % 5 === 0 && i % 3 !== 0) {
      temp.push('Buzz');
    } else if (i % 15 === 0) {
      temp.push('FizzBuzz');
    } else {
      temp.push(`${i}`);
    }
  }

  return temp;
};
```
