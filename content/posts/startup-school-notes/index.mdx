## 1. Deciding to start a startup

### Before the startup

- Startups are so weird that if you trust your instincts, you'll make a lot of mistakes.
- The way to succeed in a startup is not to be an expert on startups, but to be an expert on your users and the problem you're solving for them.
- If you start a startup, it will take over your life to a degree you cannot imagine. And if your startup succeeds, it will take over your life for a long time. So there is a real opportunity cost here.
- If you're absolutely terrified of starting a startup, you probably shouldn't do it. But if you're merely unsure whether you're up to it, the only way to find out is to try. Just not now.
- The component of entrepreneurship that really matters is domain expertise. The way to become Larry Page was to become an expert on search. And the way to become an expert on search was to be driven by genuine curiosity, not some ulterior motive.
- At its best, starting a startup is merely an ulterior motive for curiosity. And you'll do it best if you introduce the ulterior motive toward the end of the process.
