In this article, you will learn how to use **React Fragments** effectively in order to return multiple elements. React Fragments were originally introduced in React v16 and instantly became popular within the React community. React Fragments lets you group a list of children without adding extra `div` tags. That is a one small step for you, one giant leap for smaller and cleaner DOM.

Let's reflect on this using a casual situation which we come across on a daily basis.

```jsx
const App = () => (
  <Header />
  <Content />
  <Footer />
);
```

This piece of code looks straight-forward enough to fully understand it, yet no matter how it looks, it is going to bring `Parse Error: Adjacent JSX elements must be wrapped in an enclosing tag`. In this situation we usually were fixing it with wrapping everything within the `div` tags and it was working quite well, yet it had one downside - it was adding extra elements to the DOM.

```jsx
const App = () => (
  <div>
    <Header />
    <Content />
    <Footer />
  </div>
);
```

With the release of the React v16, React Fragments API has being introduced which the core idea was to remove the need for wrapping everything within an extra `div` tags.

```jsx
const App = () => (
  <React.Fragment>
    <Header />
    <Content />
    <Footer />
  </React.Fragment>
);
```

Simple as that we make our DOM cleaner!
