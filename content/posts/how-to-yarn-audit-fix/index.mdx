You might previously use commands like `npm audit` or `yarn audit` to perform a vulnerability audit against the installed packages. In case any vulnerable dependencies found to update it you could use built-in `npm audit fix` command. It would automatically install any compatible updates to vulnerable dependencies. Surprisingly, there is no `yarn` alternative to fix it in the way `npm` does, yet there are several workarounds which you can do.

## Use yarn-audit-fix package

The very straight forward option is to use `yarn-audit-fix` [package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/yarn-audit-fix).

1. Installation

```
yarn add yarn-audit-fix -D
```

Alternatively, you can use `npx`.

```
npx yarn-audit-fix
```

2. Usage

```
yarn-audit-fix
```

## Use npm audit fix as a temporary option

This is my preferable approach to fix vulnerable dependencies.

1. Generate the `package-lock.json` file without installing node modules

```
npm install --package-lock-only
```

2. Fix the packages and update the `package-lock.json` file

```
npm audit fix
```

3. Remove the `yarn.lock` file and import the `package-lock.json` file into `yarn.lock`

```
rm yarn.lock

yarn import
```

4. Remove the `package-lock.json` file

```
rm package-lock.json
```
