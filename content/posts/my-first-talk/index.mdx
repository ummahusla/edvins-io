I recently had the opportunity to give my first talk on Maximising performance with React code-splitting techniques at a local developer meetup (Devclub.lv). While it was undoubtedly a nerve-wracking experience, I must admit that it didn't go as smoothly as I had hoped. As soon as I stood in front of the audience and saw the room filled with enthusiastic faces, I found myself paralysed with stage fright, and it felt as though all my well-prepared thoughts vanished into thin air.

However, despite the initial setback, I realised this "failure" was a valuable learning experience. It taught me the importance of embracing challenges and stepping out of my comfort zone. By confronting my fear head-on, I discovered immense potential for growth and development, even in moments of vulnerability. I learned the significance of thorough preparation and the need to practice speaking to others to build confidence. I also discovered the power of resilience and the importance of bouncing back from setbacks, as they are inevitable stepping stones to success.

As I reflect on this humbling experience, I'm reminded of the words of Thomas Edison: "I have not failed. I've just found 10,000 ways that won't work." Failure is not a destination but a stepping stone towards improvement. I'm grateful for this opportunity, as it has inspired me to refine my public speaking skills and embrace future challenges with a newfound determination.

I look forward to growing as a developer and sharing my knowledge with the community more effectively.
