My approach to solving [HackerRankâ€™s Breaking the Records](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/breaking-best-and-worst-records/problem) code challenge.

---

### Problem

Maria plays college basketball and wants to go pro. Each season she maintains a record of her play. She tabulates the number of times she breaks her season record for most points and least points in a game. Points scored in the first game establish her record for the season, and she begins counting from there.

### Example

`scores = [12, 24, 10, 24]`

Scores are in the same order as the games played. She tabulates her results as follows:

```
                                   Count
  Game  Score  Minimum  Maximum   Min Max
    0      12     12       12       0   0
    1      24     12       24       0   1
    2      10     10       24       1   1
    3      24     10       24       1   1
```

Given the scores for a season, determine the number of times Maria breaks her records for most and least points scored during the season.

### Returns

int[2]: An array with the numbers of times she broke her records. Index `0` is for breaking most points records, and index `1` is for breaking least points records.

### Input format

The first line contains an integer `n`, the number of games.

The second line contains `n` space-separated integers describing the respective values of `scores0, scores1,...scoresn-1`.

### Sample input

```
9
10 5 20 20 4 5 2 25 1
```

### Sample output

```
2 4
```

### Solution

Breaking the record was a relatively easy challenge to implement. Initially, we created a bunch of variables to hold max (`hiScore`) and min (`loBroke`) values and variables for the cases when the high (`hiBroke`) and lowest (`loBroke`) scores were updated. For the values which hold the actual score, we assign it to the first array's element.

Then we start the `for` loop and go through every array element. We compare the current value (`scores[i]`) twice during each loop.

The first time, we want to check if the current value is bigger than the current highest score (`hiScore`) value. If so, it becomes the new highest score value, and we bump `hiBroke` by `1` as it is a new record break.

During the second comparison, we do the same, but this time we check for the current value (`scores[i]`) being less than the lowest score (`loScore`). The same story happens here; if it's less, it means a new record break, and we update the `loScore` bump `loBroke` by `1`.

```js
function breakingRecords(scores) {
  let hiScore = scores[0],
    loScore = scores[0];
  let hiBroke = 0,
    loBroke = 0;

  for (let i = 0; i < scores.length; i++) {
    if (scores[i] > hiScore) {
      hiScore = scores[i];
      hiBroke++;
    }

    if (scores[i] < loScore) {
      loScore = scores[i];
      loBroke++;
    }
  }

  return [hiBroke, loBroke];
}
```
