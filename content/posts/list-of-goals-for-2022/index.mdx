During 2021 I had many ups and downs which affected my **discipline, focus and mental clarity**. These are crucial abilities to succeed in life.

- Become disciplined, indistractable and learn how to deep focus.

**Reading**. The goal is to read two books per month or one book per two weeks.

- Read 24 books<br />

    ↳ I'm interested in are programming, business, psychology, self-help, science, investing,
    philosophy books.
  </span>

**Eating, exercising, and sleeping**. I didn't have consistency in any of those habits last year. This year, I will make sure to improve these core areas as early as possible.

- Drink plenty of water (~1.5l, every day)
- Run (2-3 times per week)<br />

- Stop overeating
- Fast (~13-16 hours, 2-3 times per week)<br />
