Idle games like **Melvor Idle** or **Cookie Clicker**, all share that small but satisfying moment when you come back after a break and the game greets you:

> "Welcome back! You were away for 2 hours and earned 240 gold." (example from Cookie Clicker)

In this post, we'll rebuild that _offline progress calculation_ mechanic - the "Welcome Back" screen - in **React**.
We'll keep it simple, using `localStorage` for persistence, and later talk about how this could be made secure with a backend like Supabase.

### The core idea

In an idle game, you don't simulate the world every second. You just record **when** the player started an action, and when they return, you calculate how much time passed.

The whole mechanic can be expressed in a single formula:

```js
gained = Math.floor((now - last_saved) / tick_ms) * rate;
```

That's it.
Whether the player closed the tab, lost connection, or left for a day, the game can instantly compute progress based on timestamps.

### Flow overview

Here's what actually happens behind the scenes when you perform an idle action, close the game, and come back later.
The logic is simple - record the start time, calculate how long you were away, and reward progress accordingly.

### Why this design is clever

- Lightweight - no background timers or intervals needed
- Scalable - only a few timestamps per player
- Deterministic - can always be recalculated exactly (as long as the server and client clocks are synced)
- Cheat-resistant - if stored on the server, local clock tricks don't work

### Building it in React

Here's the full code for the demo.
When you click "Start chopping", the game records a timestamp.
If you close or refresh the page, it will greet you on return with the calculated offline progress.

#### `useIdleDemo` hook

```ts
import { useEffect, useState } from 'react';

const STORAGE_KEY = 'idleChoppingData';
const TICK_MS = 3000; // 1 wood every 3s
const WOOD_PER_TICK = 1;
export const woodPerMinute = (WOOD_PER_TICK * 60000) / TICK_MS;
export const woodPerHour = woodPerMinute * 60;

export function useIdleDemo() {
  const [wood, setWood] = useState(0);
  const [startedAt, setStartedAt] = useState<number | null>(null);
  const [welcome, setWelcome] = useState<string | null>(null);
  const [isRunning, setIsRunning] = useState(false);

  // On load — check for ongoing or past session
  useEffect(() => {
    const saved = JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem(STORAGE_KEY) || 'null');
    if (!saved) return;

    const { wood: savedWood, startedAt: savedStartedAt } = saved;
    setWood(savedWood ?? 0);

    if (savedStartedAt) {
      const now = Date.now();
      const diff = now - savedStartedAt;
      const gained = Math.floor(diff / TICK_MS);
      if (gained > 0) {
        setWelcome(
          `Welcome back! You were away ${Math.floor(diff / 1000)}s and earned ${gained} wood.`
        );
        setWood(savedWood + gained);
      } else {
        // still running session
        setStartedAt(savedStartedAt);
        setIsRunning(true);
      }
    }
  }, []);

  const start = () => {
    const now = Date.now();
    setStartedAt(now);
    setIsRunning(true);
    localStorage.setItem(STORAGE_KEY, JSON.stringify({ wood, startedAt: now }));
  };

  const stop = () => {
    if (!startedAt) return;
    const now = Date.now();
    const diff = now - startedAt;
    const gained = Math.floor(diff / TICK_MS);
    const total = wood + gained;
    setWood(total);
    setStartedAt(null);
    setIsRunning(false);
    localStorage.setItem(STORAGE_KEY, JSON.stringify({ wood: total }));
  };

  const applyWelcome = () => {
    const now = Date.now();
    setWelcome(null);
    setStartedAt(now);
    setIsRunning(true);
    localStorage.setItem(STORAGE_KEY, JSON.stringify({ wood, startedAt: now }));
  };

  return { wood, start, stop, welcome, applyWelcome, isRunning };
}
```

#### `IdleWelcomeDemo` component

```tsx
export default function IdleWelcomeDemo() {
  const { wood, start, stop, welcome, applyWelcome, isRunning } = useIdleDemo();

  return (
    <div className="p-6 bg-slate-900 text-white rounded-xl max-w-md mx-auto">
      <h2 className="text-xl font-bold mb-4">🌲 Idle "Welcome Back" Demo</h2>
      <p className="text-xs opacity-60 mb-4">
        Produces {woodPerMinute} wood/min • {woodPerHour} wood/hour
      </p>

      <p className="mb-2 text-sm opacity-75">Wood collected:</p>
      <p className="text-4xl font-semibold mb-6">{wood}</p>

      {!isRunning ? (
        <button
          onClick={start}
          className="px-4 py-2 rounded-lg bg-green-600 hover:bg-green-500 transition"
        >
          Start chopping
        </button>
      ) : (
        <button
          onClick={stop}
          className="px-4 py-2 rounded-lg bg-rose-600 hover:bg-rose-500 transition"
        >
          Stop chopping
        </button>
      )}

      {isRunning && <p className="mt-4 text-sm text-green-400">⏳ Chopping in progress...</p>}

      {welcome && (
        <div className="fixed inset-0 flex items-center justify-center bg-black/70 backdrop-blur-sm">
          <div className="bg-slate-800 p-6 rounded-lg text-center max-w-sm">
            <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold mb-2">Welcome back!</h3>
            <p className="mb-4">{welcome}</p>
            <button
              onClick={applyWelcome}
              className="px-4 py-2 bg-indigo-600 hover:bg-indigo-500 rounded-lg"
            >
              Continue
            </button>
          </div>
        </div>
      )}

      <p className="text-xs text-slate-400 mt-6">
        💡 Try closing or switching tabs for a bit, then come back to see how much wood you've
        earned.
      </p>
    </div>
  );
}
```

### Playable demo

### Protecting against cheating

In a real game, relying on the browser's clock means a player could just change their system time and "earn" a week's worth of resources instantly.

That's why production idle games move this logic to the backend.
The server stores the official `started_at` timestamp and uses server time to calculate the difference.
The same formula applies - it just uses an authoritative clock instead of `Date.now()`.

If you're using **Supabase**, this becomes a simple RPC call that updates progress based on `now()` on the database side.

### Wrapping up

This small demo captures the core of how idle games handle offline progress:
save a timestamp, calculate elapsed time, reward the player, and resume.

It's **simple**, **cheap**, and **reliable** - exactly why so many games use it.

In the next post, we'll move this logic into Supabase and make it fully server-authoritative, just like real idle or MMO systems.
