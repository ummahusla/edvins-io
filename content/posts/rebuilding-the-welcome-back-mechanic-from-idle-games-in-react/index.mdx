Idle games like **Melvor Idle** or **Cookie Clicker**, all share that small but satisfying moment when you come back after a break and the game greets you:

> "Welcome back! You were away for 2 hours and earned 240 gold."

In this post, we'll rebuild that _offline progress calculation_ mechanic - the "Welcome Back" screen - in **React**.
We'll keep it simple, using `localStorage` for persistence, and later talk about how this could be made secure with a backend like Supabase.

### The core idea

In an idle game, you don't simulate the world every second. You just record **when** the player started an action, and when they return, you calculate how much time passed.

The whole mechanic can be expressed in a single formula:

```js
gained = Math.floor((now - last_saved) / tick_ms) * rate;
```

That's it.
Whether the player closed the tab, lost connection, or left for a day, the game can instantly compute progress based on timestamps.

### Flow overview

Here's what actually happens behind the scenes when you perform an idle action, close the game, and come back later.
The logic is simple - record the start time, calculate how long you were away, and reward progress accordingly.

### Why this design is clever

- Lightweight - no background timers or intervals needed
- Scalable - only a few timestamps per player
- Deterministic - can always be recalculated exactly (as long as the server and client clocks are synced)
- Cheat-resistant - if stored on the server, local clock tricks don't work

### Building it in React

Here's the full code for the demo.
When you click "Start chopping", the game records a timestamp.
If you close or refresh the page, it will greet you on return with the calculated offline progress.

```ts
import { useEffect, useState } from 'react';

const STORAGE_KEY = 'idleChoppingData';
const TICK_MS = 3000; // 1 wood every 3s
const WOOD_PER_TICK = 1;
export const woodPerMinute = (WOOD_PER_TICK * 60000) / TICK_MS;
export const woodPerHour = woodPerMinute * 60;

function formatTimeDifference(ms: number): string {
  const seconds = Math.floor(ms / 1000);
  const minutes = Math.floor(seconds / 60);
  const hours = Math.floor(minutes / 60);
  const days = Math.floor(hours / 24);

  const parts: string[] = [];

  if (days > 0) {
    parts.push(`${days} ${days === 1 ? 'day' : 'days'}`);
  }
  if (hours % 24 > 0) {
    parts.push(`${hours % 24} ${hours % 24 === 1 ? 'hour' : 'hours'}`);
  }
  if (minutes % 60 > 0) {
    parts.push(`${minutes % 60} ${minutes % 60 === 1 ? 'minute' : 'minutes'}`);
  }
  if (seconds % 60 > 0) {
    parts.push(`${seconds % 60} ${seconds % 60 === 1 ? 'second' : 'seconds'}`);
  }

  if (parts.length === 0) return 'a moment';
  if (parts.length === 1) return parts[0];

  const last = parts.pop();
  return `${parts.join(', ')} and ${last}`;
}

export function useIdleDemo() {
  const [wood, setWood] = useState(0);
  const [startedAt, setStartedAt] = useState<number | null>(null);
  const [welcome, setWelcome] = useState<string | null>(null);
  const [isRunning, setIsRunning] = useState(false);

  // On load — check for ongoing or past session
  useEffect(() => {
    const saved = JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem(STORAGE_KEY) || 'null');
    if (!saved) return;

    const { wood: savedWood, startedAt: savedStartedAt } = saved;
    setWood(savedWood ?? 0);

    if (savedStartedAt) {
      const now = Date.now();
      const diff = now - savedStartedAt;
      const gained = Math.floor(diff / TICK_MS);
      if (gained > 0) {
        setWelcome(`You were away for ${formatTimeDifference(diff)} and gathered ${gained} wood.`);
        setWood(savedWood + gained);
      } else {
        // still running session
        setStartedAt(savedStartedAt);
        setIsRunning(true);
      }
    }
  }, []);

  const start = () => {
    const now = Date.now();
    setStartedAt(now);
    setIsRunning(true);
    localStorage.setItem(STORAGE_KEY, JSON.stringify({ wood, startedAt: now }));
  };

  const stop = () => {
    if (!startedAt) return;
    const now = Date.now();
    const diff = now - startedAt;
    const gained = Math.floor(diff / TICK_MS);
    const total = wood + gained;
    setWood(total);
    setStartedAt(null);
    setIsRunning(false);
    localStorage.setItem(STORAGE_KEY, JSON.stringify({ wood: total }));
  };

  const applyWelcome = () => {
    const now = Date.now();
    setWelcome(null);
    setStartedAt(now);
    setIsRunning(true);
    localStorage.setItem(STORAGE_KEY, JSON.stringify({ wood, startedAt: now }));
  };

  return { wood, start, stop, welcome, applyWelcome, isRunning };
}

export default function IdleWelcomeDemo() {
  const { wood, start, stop, welcome, applyWelcome, isRunning } = useIdleDemo();

  return (
    <div className="relative overflow-hidden py-1 px-6 mt-6 mb-6 bg-slate-900 text-white rounded-xl">

  );
}

### Breaking down the code

**1. State structure**

- We track `wood`, `startedAt`, and `isRunning` in state.
- `wood` represents total resources collected so far, while `startedAt` stores the timestamp of when chopping began.
- We also use `welcome` to store the "you were away for X seconds" message shown when returning.

**2. Offline progress logic**

- When the page loads, we check `localStorage` for any saved data.
- If `startedAt` exists, we calculate how much time passed since it was saved using `Date.now() - startedAt`.
- Then we determine how many 3-second ticks fit into that gap and award the correct amount of wood.

**3.Session control**

- Clicking Start chopping saves the current timestamp and sets `isRunning = true`.
- Clicking Stop chopping calculates progress up to that moment, adds it to total `wood`, and resets the timer.
- Everything persists to `localStorage`, so progress isn't lost on refresh.

**4.Welcome back screen**

- When a returning player's elapsed time is detected, we show a small modal with a message like
  "Welcome back! You were away 120s and earned 40 wood."
- The player can click Continue to dismiss it and resume chopping automatically.

**5. Persistence and security**

- Since this demo is client-only, everything is stored in `localStorage`.
- For a production setup, you'd move this logic to a backend (like Supabase, _yes I'm Supabase fanboy_) and rely on server time for accurate, cheat-proof progress calculation. _But that's for another post._

### Protecting against cheating

In a real game, relying on the browser's clock means a player could just change their system time and "earn" a week's worth of resources instantly.

That's why production idle games move this logic to the backend.
The server stores the official `started_at` timestamp and uses server time to calculate the difference.
The same formula applies - it just uses an authoritative clock instead of `Date.now()`.

If you're using **Supabase**, this becomes a simple RPC call that updates progress based on `now()` on the database side.

### Wrapping up

This small demo captures the core of how idle games handle offline progress:
save a timestamp, calculate elapsed time, reward the player, and resume.

It's **simple**, **cheap**, and **reliable** - exactly why so many games use it.
