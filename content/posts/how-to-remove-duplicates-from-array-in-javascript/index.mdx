There are multiple ways how to remove a duplicate value from a JavaScript array using `indexOf()` and `filter()`, and `forEach()` and `include()` methods. Yet using `Set` with a combination of `spread operator` is the simplest approach.

A `Set` is an iterable object which lets you store unique values of any type, whether primitive values or object references. We use the spread syntax (`...`) to convert the `Set` object to an array.

```js
const arr = [1, 2, 3, 5, 3, 8, 13, 13, 21, 5, 3, 2, 21];

console.log([...new Set(arr)]);
// Output: [1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21]
```
