### Problem

Implement a function `chunk(array, [size=1])` that splits the input array into groups of length `size` and returns them within a **new** array. If array can't be split evenly, the final chunk will be the remaining elements. The function should not modify the original input array.

### Arguments

- `array (Array)`: The array to process.
- `[size=1] (number)`: The length of each chunk.

### Returns

- _(Array)_: Returns the new array of chunks.

### Example

```js
chunk(['a', 'b', 'c', 'd']); // => [['a'], ['b'], ['c'], ['d']]
chunk([1, 2, 3, 4], 2); // => [[1, 2], [3, 4]]
chunk([1, 2, 3, 4], 3); // => [[1, 2, 3], [4]]
```

The function should return an empty array if the `array` argument is empty.

Initially, while implementing it, I haven't found a good pattern to follow. I ended up with a solution that was not very elegant, and I was not happy with it. So I decided to look for other solutions online, and I found a very elegant solution on [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/8495687/split-array-into-chunks), what a surprise, right? So I decided to implement it myself to understand it better and it can be found in the code below.

### Solution (my approach)

It first checks if the input array is empty (has a length of 0). If it is, the function immediately returns an empty array `[]`.

Next, it checks if the length of the input array is 1 or smaller than the specified chunk size. If either of these conditions is true, it means the array cannot be chunked further, so the function returns an array containing the input array itself as the only element. For example, if the array is `[1, 2, 3]`, and the chunk size is 5, the function would return `[[1, 2, 3]]`.

The function initializes two empty arrays: `chunked` and `current`.

It then iterates through each element of the input array using `array.forEach((elem, index) => {...})`.

For each element in the input array, the code checks if the `current` array has reached the desired chunk size (`size`). If not, the element is added to the `current` array using `current.push(elem)`.

Once the `current` array has reached the specified chunk size, it means a chunk is complete, so the `current` array is added to the `chunked` array using `chunked.push(current)`. Then, the `current` array is reset to an empty array to start forming the next chunk.

After the loop finishes iterating through the input array, there might be a partially filled `current` array left if the input array length is not divisible by the chunk size. In that case, this remaining chunk is added to the `chunked` array.

Finally, the function returns the `chunked` array, which contains the input array split into smaller sub-arrays of the specified size.

```js
export default function chunk(array, size = 1) {
  if (!array.length) return [];
  if (array.length === 1 || array.length < size) return [array];

  let chunked = [];
  let current = [];

  array.forEach((elem, index) => {
    if (current.length < size) {
      current.push(elem);
    }

    if (current.length === size) {
      chunked.push(current);
      current = [];
    }

    if (array.length - 1 === index && current.length) {
      chunked.push(current);
    }
  });

  return chunked;
}
```

### Solution 2 (using slice)

This solution, utilises a `for` loop to achieve the same result. It employs the `slice()` method to extract chunks from the input array and directly pushes them into the `chunked` array. This approach avoids the need for maintaining a temporary array and the associated conditional checks. The second implementation is more concise and efficient for chunking the array.

```js
export default function chunk(array, size = 1) {
  if (!array.length) return [];

  const chunked = [];

  for (let i = 0; i < array.length; i += size) {
    const currentChunk = array.slice(i, i + size);
    chunked.push(currentChunk);
  }

  return chunked;
}
```
