In this step-by-step tutorial, I will show you how to deploy React application to the [Firebase Hosting](https://firebase.google.com/docs/hosting).

> Firebase Hosting provides fast and secure hosting for your web app, static and dynamic content, and microservices.

## Initial setup

We are going to need an application which we are going to deploy. For the demonstation purposes, I'm going to scaffold a new [create-react-app](https://create-react-app.dev/) aplication and name it as `deploy-cra-to-firebase`.

```
$ npx create-react-app deploy-cra-to-firebase
```

<br />

---

<br />

## Install Firebase CLI

Next step is to install the [Firebase CLI](https://github.com/firebase/firebase-tools) (actually its called `firebase-tools`, but I still reference it as `firebase-cli` for some reason.) which provides a variety of tools for managing, viewing, and deploying to Firebase projects.

```
$ npm install -g firebase-tools
```

## Firebase login

In order to use a Firebase Hosting, you need to have an account for it. So you will need either create a new one or use the existing one. When it's sorted, just run next command.

```
$ firebase login
```

## Firebase project and hosting setup

Now its the time to initialise Firebase. You will be asked a variety of questions related to project and hosting setup. Don't worry if you made a mistake while completing this step. You can amend those settings except `unique project id`. I've used `deploy-my-cra-to-firebase` for both `Project ID` and `Project Name`.

```
$ firebase init
```

In Firebase Hosting setup section make sure you answer like this.

- What do you want to use as your public directory? `build`
- Configure as a single-page app (rewrite all urls to /index.html) `Yes`
- File build/index.html already exists. Overwrite? `Yes`

```
$ firebase init

You're about to initialize a Firebase project in this directory:

  /Users/edvinsantonovs/Documents/repos/deploy-cra-to-firebase

? Which Firebase CLI features do you want to set up for this folder? Press
Space to select features, then Enter to confirm your choices. Hosting: Conf
igure and deploy Firebase Hosting sites

=== Project Setup

First, let's associate this project directory with a Firebase project.
You can create multiple project aliases by running firebase use --add,
but for now we'll just set up a default project.

? Please select an option: Create a new project
i  If you want to create a project in a Google Cloud organization or folder, please use "firebase projects:create" instead, and return to this command when you've created the project.
? Please specify a unique project id (warning: cannot be modified afterward
) [6-30 characters]:
 deploy-my-cra-to-firebase
? What would you like to call your project? (defaults to your project ID)
✔ Creating Google Cloud Platform project
✔ Adding Firebase resources to Google Cloud Platform project

🎉🎉🎉 Your Firebase project is ready! 🎉🎉🎉

Project information:
   - Project ID: deploy-my-cra-to-firebase
   - Project Name: deploy-my-cra-to-firebase

Firebase console is available at
https://console.firebase.google.com/project/deploy-my-cra-to-firebase/overview
i  Using project deploy-my-cra-to-firebase (deploy-my-cra-to-firebase)

=== Hosting Setup

Your public directory is the folder (relative to your project directory) that
will contain Hosting assets to be uploaded with firebase deploy. If you
have a build process for your assets, use your build's output directory.

? What do you want to use as your public directory? build
? Configure as a single-page app (rewrite all urls to /index.html)? Yes
? File build/index.html already exists. Overwrite? Yes
✔  Wrote build/index.html

i  Writing configuration info to firebase.json...
i  Writing project information to .firebaserc...

✔  Firebase initialization complete!
```

When setup is complete, you should see auto-generated `firebase.json` and `.firebaserc` files which look like this.

- `firebase.json`

```
{
  "hosting": {
    "public": "build",
    "ignore": ["firebase.json", "**/.*", "**/node_modules/**"],
    "rewrites": [
      {
        "source": "**",
        "destination": "/index.html"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

- `.firebaserc`

```
{
  "projects": {
    "default": "deploy-my-cra-to-firebase"
  }
}
```

<br />

## Build

- `$ yarn build`

## Firebase deploy

- `$ firebase deplop`

## Done
