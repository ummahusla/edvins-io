There are certain types of content management systems - **Coupled CMS** and **Decoupled CMS**. The **coupled CMS** is also known as a **traditional** or **monolith** architecture. In a coupled CMS, the back-end is bound to the front-end. As an example of coupled CMS — **[WordPress](https://wordpress.org/)** or **[Drupal](https://www.drupal.org/)**. It allows users to create content, save it to the back-end and serve it to the front-end. Usually, the coupled CMS allows users to style and customise the frontend, but often those changes are limited.

This is the reason why the **decoupled CMS** comes into play. The decoupled CMS is also known as a **headless CMS**. The headless CMS is a back-end only content management system which provides the **RESTful API** which can be used to build any front-end around. The number of options in terms of languages or frameworks is unlimited.

> "The term **headless** comes from the concept of chopping the **head** (the front end, i.e. the website) off the **body** (the back end, i.e. the content repository)" — Wikipedia
