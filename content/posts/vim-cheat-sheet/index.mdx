Nowadays, not many people still use [Vim](https://www.vim.org/), yet there are people like me who are still like to use it form time to time. This cheat sheet started as a [GitHub Gist](https://gist.github.com/ummahusla/98b381e0355e43973085) approximately 5 years ago, and it's still relevant and helpful for me today.

## Modes

Vim has two modes insertion mode and command mode. The editor begins in command mode, where the cursor movement and text deletion and pasting occur. Insertion mode begins upon entering an insertion or change command. `[ESC]` returns the editor to command mode (where you can quit, for example by typing `:q!`). Most commands execute as soon as you type them except for "colon" commands which execute when you press the return key.

---

## Quitting

- `:x` Exit, saving changes
- `:q` Exit as long as there have been no changes
- `ZZ` Exit and save changes if any have been made
- `:q!` Exit and ignore any changes

---

- `i` Insert before cursor
- `I` Insert before line
- `a` Append after cursor
- `A` Append after line
- `o` Open a new line after current line
- `O` Open a new line before current line
- `r` Replace one character
- `R` Replace many characters

---

## Search for strings

## Deleting text

Almost all deletion commands are performed by typing `d` followed by a motion. For example, `dw` deletes a word. A few other deletes are:

- `x` Delete character to the right of cursor
- `X` Delete character to the left of cursor
- `D` Delete to the end of the line
- `dd` Delete current line
- `:d` Delete current line

## Replace

The search and replace function is accomplished with the `:s` command. It is commonly used in combination with ranges or the `:g` command (below).

- `:s/pattern/string/flags` Replace pattern with string according to flags. (Example: `:%s/foo/bar/`. Find each occurrence of `foo` (in all lines), and replace it with `bar`.)
- `g` Flag - Replace all occurrences of pattern
- `c` Flag - Confirm replaces.
- `&` Repeat last `:s` command
