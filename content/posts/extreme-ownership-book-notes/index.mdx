[Extreme Ownership](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/23848190) is a book by Jocko Willink and Leif Babin that teaches leadership and management principles. It became my 2nd best favourite book after the Atomic Habits book.

The book's main concept is the idea of extreme ownership, which means taking full responsibility for one's actions and decisions and not making excuses or blaming others. The book also stresses the importance of clear communication, setting clear goals, and creating a culture of ownership within an organization. Additionally, the book covers the importance of developing a warrior mentality and adapting to changing circumstances.

### No bad teams, only bad leaders

A few additional concepts covered in Extreme Ownership are worth mentioning. One is the concept of no bad teams, only bad leaders. The book argues that a leader's job is to create an environment in which the team can succeed, and if the team is failing, the leader must take responsibility and make the necessary changes.

### Prioritizing and executing

Another concept is the idea of prioritizing and executing The book stresses the importance of setting clear priorities and taking action to achieve them. This involves breaking down larger goals into smaller, manageable tasks and then taking the necessary steps to complete them.

### Decentralized command

The book also talks about the importance of decentralized command. This means giving team members the autonomy and resources to make decisions and take action on their own rather than relying on a central authority to make decisions for them.

### Disciplined execution

Finally, the book emphasizes the importance of disciplined execution to achieve success. This involves having a clear plan, staying focused on the goal, and taking action consistently and persistently over time.
