Implementing your version of popular JavaScript functions is a fairly trivial interview question, so to prepare for it, I decided to implement all of them on my own as a part of the interview process. `Array.map()` is a starting point in the series. The next ones in the queue are `Array.filter()` and `Array.reduce()`.

### What is `Array.map()`?

To begin with, let’s first figure out what `Array.map()` is. `Array.map()` is a built-in JavaScript function for array manipulations and transformations based on the existing array. `Array.map()` iterates each element of the existing array and applies a callback function for each element. `Array.map()` doesn't mutate the original array. Instead, it returns a new one.

```js
const arr = [1, 2, 3];

const doubled = arr.map((elem) => elem * 2);

console.log(doubled);
// Output: [2, 4, 6]
```

### Implementing your version of `Array.map()`

Now, let’s implement `myMap()` function, which will act as your `Array.map()` replacement.

The `myMap()` function takes an `arr` (array) and a `cb` (callback) function as arguments. It returns a new array that results from applying the callback function to each input array element.

```js
const myMap = (arr, cb) => {
  let temp = [];

  for (let i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
    if (arr.hasOwnProperty(i)) {
      temp.push(cb(arr[i]));
    }
  }

  return temp;
};
```

Let’s quickly go through the code to figure out what it does.

We start by creating a new empty array `temp`

```js
let temp = [];
```

Then we loop through each element of the input array `arr`

```js
for (let i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
  // loop code
}
```

We do `hasOwnProperty`` check ensures that the callback is only executed on elements that actually exist in the array, and it won't be invoked for undefined elements or holes in the array.

```js
if (arr.hasOwnProperty(i)) {
  ...
}
```

Inside the loop, it applies the callback function `cb` to the current element of the input array `arr[i]`. Finally, the result is pushed into a temporary array `temp`.

```js
temp.push(cb(arr[i]));
```

After we finish with the loop, we return the `temp` array.

```js
return temp;
```

That's it! Now you can use `myMap()` as an alternative replacement to the existing `Array.map()` function.

```js
const arr = [1, 2, 3];

const doubled = myMap(arr, (elem) => elem * 2);

console.log(doubled);
// Output: [2, 4, 6]
```
