### Problem

Debouncing is a technique used to control how many times we allow a function to be executed over time. When a JavaScript function is debounced with a wait time of X milliseconds, it must wait until after X milliseconds have elapsed since the debounced function was last called. You almost certainly have encountered debouncing in your daily lives before â€” when entering an elevator. Only after X duration of not pressing the "Door open" button (the debounced function not being called) will the elevator door actually close (the callback function is executed).

Implement a `debounce` function which accepts a callback function and a `wait` duration. Calling `debounce()` returns a function which has debounced invocations of the callback function following the behavior described above.

> "Debounce, along with throttle, are among the most common front end interview questions; it's the front end equivalent of inverting a binary tree" - [GreatFrontEnd](https://www.greatfrontend.com/?fpr=edvins).

### Example

```js
let i = 0;
function increment() {
  i++;
}
const debouncedIncrement = debounce(increment, 100);

// t = 0: Call debouncedIncrement().
debouncedIncrement(); // i = 0

// t = 50: i is still 0 because 100ms have not passed.

// t = 100: increment() was invoked and i is now 1.
```

`debouncedIncrement()` is called multiple times.

```js
let i = 0;
function increment() {
  i++;
}
const debouncedIncrement = debounce(increment, 100);

// t = 0: Call debouncedIncrement().
debouncedIncrement(); // i = 0

// t = 50: i is still 0 because 100ms have not passed.
//  Call debouncedIncrement() again.
debouncedIncrement(); // i = 0

// t = 100: i is still 0 because it has only
//  been 50ms since the last debouncedIncrement() at t = 50.

// t = 150: Because 100ms have passed since
//  the last debouncedIncrement() at t = 50,
//  increment was invoked and i is now 1 .
```

### Solution

I came across this code challenge some time ago, I couldn't provide a fully working solution from the first attemp. It was especially hard while writing it in Microsoft Docs. Apparently I rely too hard on console.log and test cases was way harder then during my second attempt to crack it on [GreatFrontend](https://www.greatfrontend.com/questions/javascript/debounce).

```js
/**
 * @param {Function} func
 * @param {number} wait
 * @return {Function}
 */
export default function debounce(func, wait = 0) {
  let timeoutID = null;

  return function (...args) {
    const context = this;
    clearTimeout(timeoutID);

    timeoutID = setTimeout(() => {
      timeoutID = null;
      func.apply(context, args);
    }, wait);
  };
}
```
