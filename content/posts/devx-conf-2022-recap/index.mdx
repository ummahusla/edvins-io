Last week I’ve attended [DevX Conf 2022](https://devxconf.org/). I’ve watched 2 days’ worth of talks on the developer experience (DX) topic and made a list of talks which I liked the most. Thus to share it with my colleagues and developers I know.

DevX Conf, so what's it about? It's all about the developer experience. About the daily experience when trying to get the job done. About the developers who write code, use tools, and glue them together to chains. About the developers who review code, communicate and collaborate with colleagues and customers. All that should be efficient, sustainable and joyful.
