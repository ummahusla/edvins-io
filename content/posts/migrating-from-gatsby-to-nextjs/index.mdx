After 5 years of running my blog on Gatsby, I migrated to Next.js. My Gatsby blog stopped working.

---

## Why migrate?

**Dependency hell.** I hadn't updated packages regularly. When I ran `gatsby develop`, everything broke. Outdated plugins, conflicting dependencies, GraphQL version mismatches. I spent hours trying to fix it and realized I didn't want to maintain this complexity.

I needed something simpler that I could understand without reading plugin docs.

I used Vercel's [Portfolio Starter Kit](https://vercel.com/templates/portfolio/portfolio-starter-kit) template. It's minimal, uses Next.js, supports Markdown, and gives me full control over SEO and URL structure.

**The concern: SEO.** I had 77 blog posts indexed. Breaking those URLs wasn't an option.

---

## The migration plan

My approach:

1. **Keep the main branch as Gatsby** (the live site)
2. **Create a v1 branch** as a stable Gatsby archive
3. **Build Next.js on a v2 branch** and iterate there

If something went wrong, the live site stayed up.

```bash
git checkout -b v1
git push origin v1

git checkout main
git checkout -b v2
```

I started with Vercel's Portfolio Starter Kit template. Clean and minimal.

I can add features as I need them. Want comments? Add them. Want analytics? Drop them in.

---

## Content structure

My Gatsby setup had all blog posts in `/content/posts/[post-name]/index.mdx`. I kept this structure in Next.js.

```
content/posts/
  my-post/
    index.mdx
    image.png
```

The Next.js example used `/app/blog/posts/` with `.mdx` files directly. I rewrote the parsing logic to read from my existing structure instead. This saved me from moving 77 files around.

---

## Frontmatter cleanup

Gatsby posts had a `slug` field in frontmatter. In Next.js, I use the folder name as the slug, so this field was redundant. I found 26 posts with explicit slugs and removed them.

A few folder names didn't match their slugs, so I renamed them:

- `debounce-method-in-javascript` → `debounce-in-javascript`
- `react-text-to-speech-component` → `react-text-to-speech`
- And 2 more

The new minimal frontmatter:

```yaml
---
title: Post Title
date: 2024-01-01
description: Post description
tags:
  - React
  - Next.js
---
```

Simple.

---

## The SEO decision

The Next.js blog example uses `/blog/[slug]` URLs. My Gatsby site used `/[slug]` (posts at root level). Changing this would break every indexed URL.

I moved `app/blog/[slug]/page.tsx` → `app/[slug]/page.tsx` and updated:

- `app/components/posts.tsx` (internal links)
- `app/sitemap.ts` (sitemap generation)
- `app/rss/route.ts` (RSS feed)

This preserved all my URLs.

---

## Static assets

Images in Gatsby lived alongside the MDX files. In Next.js, they need to be in `/public`.

I wrote a script to:

1. Move images from `content/posts/[post]/image.png` → `public/posts/[post]/image.png`
2. Update MDX references: `![](./image.png)` → `![](/posts/[post]/image.png)`

The script saved hours of manual work.

---

## Dynamic OG images

My Gatsby posts had static banner images for social sharing. Each one was manually created in Figma, exported, and committed to the repo. 77 posts × ~200KB per image = **15MB of banner images**.

I switched to dynamic generation.

Created `/app/og/route.tsx`:

```tsx
import { ImageResponse } from 'next/og';
import { readFile } from 'fs/promises';
import { join } from 'path';

export async function GET(request: Request) {
  let url = new URL(request.url);
  let title = url.searchParams.get('title') || 'Edvins Antonovs';

  const geistRegular = await readFile(join(process.cwd(), 'public', 'fonts', 'Geist-Regular.ttf'));

  return new ImageResponse(
    (
      <div tw="flex flex-col w-full h-full items-center justify-center bg-black px-16">
        <div tw="flex flex-col w-full">
          <h1 style={{ fontFamily: 'Geist' }} tw="text-7xl font-bold text-white leading-tight mb-8">
            {title}
          </h1>
          <p style={{ fontFamily: 'Geist' }} tw="text-3xl text-gray-400">
            edvins.io
          </p>
        </div>
      </div>
    ),
    {
      width: 1200,
      height: 630,
      fonts: [
        {
          name: 'Geist',
          data: geistRegular,
          style: 'normal',
          weight: 400,
        },
      ],
    }
  );
}
```

The design is minimalist: black background, white title in large Geist font, with "edvins.io" in smaller gray text below. Clean and professional.

### Using Geist font

To match my site's branding, I wanted to use Geist (Vercel's font) in the OG images. The trick is to download the font locally rather than fetching it from a CDN:

```bash
mkdir -p public/fonts
curl -L "https://github.com/vercel/geist-font/raw/main/packages/next/dist/fonts/geist-sans/Geist-Regular.ttf" -o public/fonts/Geist-Regular.ttf
```

Using `readFile` to load the local font is more reliable than fetching from external URLs.

Now every post gets an OG image at `/og?title=Post+Title`.

**Benefits:**

- No more opening Figma for every post
- Repo size dropped by 15MB
- Faster builds (no image processing)
- Consistent design across all posts
- Easy to update the template once
- Uses the same font as the website

The images are generated on-demand and cached by Vercel.

## Interactive components

This was the trickiest part. I had 5 posts with interactive React components embedded in MDX:

- GoldMineDemo (Clash of Clans building demo)
- CultivateDemo (habit tracker with video)
- Preview (HTML table generator)
- TextToSpeech + BlogPost

Gatsby let me import these directly in MDX. Next.js with `next-mdx-remote` needs explicit registration.

I moved components to `app/components/blog/`, added `'use client'`, then registered them:

```tsx
import GoldMineDemo from './blog/GoldMineDemo';
import CultivateDemo from './blog/CultivateDemo';

let components = {
  h1: createHeading(1),
  // ... other components
  GoldMineDemo,
  CultivateDemo,
};

export function CustomMDX(props) {
  return <MDXRemote {...props} components={components} />;
}
```

Now they work just like before.

---

## Static pages

I had 4 static pages: About, Projects, Books, Self-Education. These lived in `/content/pages/` in Gatsby.

I created a utility to read them:

```typescript
export function getPage(slug: string) {
  const pagePath = path.join(process.cwd(), 'content', 'pages', slug, 'index.mdx');
  // Parse frontmatter and return content
}
```

Then created routes:

- `app/about/page.tsx`
- `app/projects/page.tsx`
- `app/books/page.tsx`
- `app/self-education/page.tsx`

Each one calls `getPage()` and renders with `CustomMDX`.

---

## Markdown tables

My Books page had a big table with 100+ entries. It rendered fine in Gatsby but broke in Next.js.

The fix: install `remark-gfm` (GitHub Flavored Markdown):

```bash
npm install remark-gfm@3
```

Note: Version 3, not 4. Version 4 has compatibility issues with `next-mdx-remote@4.x`.

Updated MDX rendering:

```tsx
import remarkGfm from 'remark-gfm';

export function CustomMDX(props) {
  return <MDXRemote {...props} options={{ mdxOptions: { remarkPlugins: [remarkGfm] } }} />;
}
```

Tables worked again. But they looked terrible on mobile with my narrow page width. I converted the Books page to a list grouped by year instead.

---

## Metadata utility

Every page needs consistent metadata (titles, descriptions, OG images, Twitter cards). I created a helper:

```typescript
export function generatePageMetadata({
  title,
  description,
  path,
  type,
  publishedTime,
  tags,
}: PageMetadataProps): Metadata {
  const ogImage = `${baseUrl}/og?title=${encodeURIComponent(title)}`;

  return {
    title,
    description,
    openGraph: {
      title,
      description,
      url: `${baseUrl}${path}`,
      siteName: 'Edvins Antonovs',
      images: [{ url: ogImage }],
      ...(publishedTime && { publishedTime }),
      ...(tags && { tags }),
    },
    twitter: {
      card: 'summary_large_image',
      images: [ogImage],
    },
  };
}
```

Now every page uses this. One place to update, everywhere stays consistent.

## What I didn't migrate

I dropped:

- PWA manifest (who installs personal blogs as apps?)
- Multiple favicon sizes (just kept `favicon.ico`, `icon.svg`, `apple-icon.png`)
- Various Gatsby plugins I never used

---

## What I learned

**Write scripts for repetitive tasks.** I made Node scripts to move images and clean frontmatter. Saved hours.

**Migrate in steps.** Blog posts first, then pages, then components. Test each part before moving on.

**Keep the old version.** I archived the Gatsby site in a branch so I could reference it anytime.

**Plan URLs first.** I kept my URL structure (`/[slug]` instead of `/blog/[slug]`) to preserve SEO. Changing URLs later would break everything.

**Drop what you don't need.** I removed half my Gatsby features. The site is better without them.

---

## Was it worth it?

Yes. The migration took a day spread over a week.

The Next.js code is cleaner. Builds are faster. I understand how my blog works now.

I can add features as I need them. No plugin mess. No GraphQL fights. Just Next.js and Markdown files.

If you're stuck in Gatsby dependency hell, start fresh. Use a minimal template. Keep your content structure and URLs. Build up from there.
