At the beginning of 2021, I was full of optimism so I’ve made [my annual list of goals public](/list-of-goals-for-2021). Long story short, me and my family got hit by a COVID-19 in the first week of January 2021. It took some time to recover from it. My focus and discipline were totally ruined due to a lack of consistency and mental clarity. I was underperforming in several areas like eating, exercising, and sleeping.

Unfortunately, it relates to me as well.

During this year, I couldn’t imagine so many ups and downs I will go through.

Finally repaid my student loan. It took me 7 years, to do so.

Joined [Sedna](https://sedna.com/) as a 2nd Front-End Engineer to build a design system and deliver amazing features.

At some point I was going through rough times, so I’ve started doing psychotherapy sessions and it helps me a lot.
