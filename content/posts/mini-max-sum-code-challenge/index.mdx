My approach to solving [HackerRankâ€™s Mini-Max Sum](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/mini-max-sum/problem) code challenge.

---

### Problem

Given five positive integers, find the minimum and maximum values that can be calculated by summing exactly four of the five integers. Then print the respective minimum and maximum values as a single line of two space-separated long integers.

### Example

`arr = [1, 3, 5, 7, 9]`

The minimum sum is `1 + 3 + 5 + 7 = 16` and the maximum sum is `3 + 5 + 7 + 9 = 24`. The function prints

```
16 12
```

### Input format

A single line of five space-separated integers.

### Output format

Print two space-separated long integers denoting the respective minimum and maximum values that can be calculated by summing exactly four of the five integers.

### Sample input

```
1 2 3 4 5
```

### Sample output

```
10 14
```

### Solution

Firstly, we will calculate a total sum of array elements using the `Array.reduce()` function and store the result as `arrSum`.

Then a temporary empty array (`tmp`) is created to be used later.

After that, we create a `for` loop where we will go through the given array. During each loop, we subtract the current loop's value (`arr[i]`) from the total sum of array elements `arrSum` and push the result to the temporary array (`tmp`) using the `Array.push()` method.

Finally, we print results (`console.log`) of the minimum (`Math.min()`) and maximum (`Math.max()`) values from a temporary array (`tmp`).

Solution complexity: `O(n)`.

```js
function miniMaxSum(arr) {
  const arrSum = arr.reduce((a, b) => a + b);
  let tmp = [];

  for (let i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
    tmp.push(arrSum - arr[i]);
  }

  console.log(Math.min(...tmp), Math.max(...tmp));
}
```
