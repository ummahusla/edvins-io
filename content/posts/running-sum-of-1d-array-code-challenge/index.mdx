My approach to solving [LeetCode’s Running sum of 1d array](https://leetcode.com/problems/running-sum-of-1d-array/) code challenge.

---

### Problem

Given an array `nums`. We define a running sum of an array as `runningSum[i] = sum(nums[0]…nums[i])`.

Return the running sum of `nums`.

### Solution

We start by creating a new temporary array (`temp`) and populating it with the first array's element (`nums[0]`). We need to do this, as below we start for loop, where during each iteration, we will be using the last temporary array value (`temp[i - 1]`) and sum it with the current's loop value (`nums[i]`). We will push the result of this addition to the `temp` array.

Finally, we return the `temp` array.

```js
var runningSum = function (nums) {
  let temp = [nums[0]];

  for (let i = 1; i < nums.length; i++) {
    temp.push(temp[i - 1] + nums[i]);
  }

  return temp;
};
```
