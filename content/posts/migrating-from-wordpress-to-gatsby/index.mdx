Initial version (v.1.0.0) of edvins.io was built around 2 years ago using [WordPress](https://wordpress.org/) based on [Underscores](https://underscores.me/) as a starter theme. I've created a custom design which was heavily inspired by [Todd Motto](http://toddmotto.com/)'s blog (before he shut it down).

I hosted it on [DigitalOcean](https://digitalocean.com/)'s cheapest droplet with a back-up option. Roughly, it costs me <!-- prettier-ignore -->$7 per month to maintain it. It wasn't too bad, but clearly, there were cheaper options. The main reason behind choosing DigitalOcean was a console level of access. I used Git as version control, so deploying a new version was just simply pushing local changes and pulling it on server trough the terminal/console.

On a side note, I've been using WordPress CMS for years for personal and client projects since 2012. I enjoyed working with it due to its simplicity and ability to go way beyond the blog functionality by using plugins like `Advanced Custom Fields` and `Custom Post Type UI`, etc.

### Time for a change

The second version (v2.0.0) of edvins.io was built around 2 weeks ago, while I was on holidays. My ultimate goal was to migrate from WordPress to [Gatsby](http://gatsbyjs.com/).

> [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/) is a React-based, GraphQL powered, static site generator. It uses powerful pre-configuration to build a website that uses only static files for incredibly fast page loads, service workers, code splitting, server-side rendering, intelligent image loading, asset optimization, and data prefetching, Markdown support, fast build and deployment times, etc.

#### Migration & Development

I've used [gatsby-theme-minimal-blog](https://github.com/LekoArts/gatsby-themes/tree/master/themes/gatsby-theme-minimal-blog) as a Gatsby starter template. Next step was to start adding features I wanted my blog to have (e.g. filtering by tag), etc. The most important thing was to understand how [Shadowing mechanism in Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/themes/shadowing/) works. I'm still working on adding new features (e.g. search by blog post name) and I fully [open-sourced this project](https://github.com/ummahusla/edvins-io), in case you want to have a look at the code.

The most time-consuming part was to convert blog posts from HTML to Markdown. Luckily, I had less than 10 posts, so using a [Turndown](https://domchristie.github.io/turndown/) (random HTML to Markdown converter) was more than enough.

Although, I finally had a chance to learn the fundamentals of GraphQL (Gatsby is powered by GraphQL) to understand how it works under the hood. I used [How To GraphQL](https://www.howtographql.com/) (free & open-source) which I found as a recommendation in Gatsby's docs.

#### Deployment

Gatsby builds static files as an output, so there is an unlimited number of deployment options. I went with [Netlify](http://netlify.com/) due to its simplicity in set up and automatic deployments. Effectively, it means that every time I do a new `git push` to `master`, new build image is automatically generated and deployed for me.

Moreover, it's worth to mention that:

- Every time you open a pull request, or push new changes to a branch, Netlify automatically builds a preview with a unique URL, which makes testing even easier.
- Free tier is more than enough to host static files in my case, saving me <!-- prettier-ignore -->~$84 / per year.

### Next steps

I have a set of features I plan to implement as a part of edvins.io v.2.0.0 as well as I plan to get write 1 blog post per week. Topics I'm interested to write about:

- Software development focusing mainly on the front-end (`JavaScript`, `React`, `Firebase`, etc)
- My side-hustle journey as an indie developer.
