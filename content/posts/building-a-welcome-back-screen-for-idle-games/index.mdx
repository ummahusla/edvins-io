Idle games live and breathe on time. That moment when you open the game and it greets you with:

> “Welcome back! You were gone for 3 hours and earned 1,258 wood.”

That’s the hook. It makes the player feel rewarded even when they weren’t actively playing.

In this post, we’ll build a simple “Welcome Back” mechanic in React.
It will track how long the player was away, calculate offline progress, and give rewards automatically when they return.

No backend required for the demo — just `localStorage` and some logic.
After that, we’ll look at how to make it secure with Supabase.

### How the system works

The concept is simple:

1. Save the current timestamp when the player closes the game.
2. When they come back, calculate how long they were gone.
3. Reward resources based on that time.
4. Cap the reward duration to prevent infinite accumulation.

We’ll simulate this with a “Chop Tree” mechanic that gives 1 wood per minute, up to 8 hours of offline progress.

### The React implementation

We’ll keep everything self-contained in a React hook and one simple component.

```tsx
import { useEffect, useState } from 'react';

const WOOD_PER_MINUTE = 100;

export function useIdleProgress() {
  const [wood, setWood] = useState(0);

  // Save timestamp and progress on exit
  useEffect(() => {
    const handleBeforeUnload = () => {
      localStorage.setItem('lastActive', Date.now().toString());
      localStorage.setItem('wood', wood.toString());
    };
    window.addEventListener('beforeunload', handleBeforeUnload);
    return () => window.removeEventListener('beforeunload', handleBeforeUnload);
  }, [wood]);

  // Calculate offline progress on load
  useEffect(() => {
    const savedWood = parseInt(localStorage.getItem('wood') || '0', 10);
    const savedTime = localStorage.getItem('lastActive');
    const now = Date.now();

    if (savedTime) {
      const diffMs = now - parseInt(savedTime);
      const diffMinutes = diffMs / 60000;
      const cappedMinutes = Math.min(diffMinutes, 480); // 8-hour cap

      const earned = Math.floor(cappedMinutes * WOOD_PER_MINUTE); // 100 wood/min
      const total = savedWood + earned;

      setWood(total);

      if (earned > 0) {
        alert(
          `🌲 Welcome back! You were away for ${Math.floor(
            diffMinutes
          )} minutes and earned ${earned} wood!`
        );
      }
    } else {
      setWood(savedWood);
    }
  }, []);

  return { wood, setWood };
}
```

### Building the UI

```tsx
import React from 'react';
import { useIdleProgress } from './useIdleProgress';

export default function ChopTree() {
  const { wood, setWood } = useIdleProgress();

  const chopTree = () => setWood((prev) => prev + 1);

  return (
    <div className="p-6 text-center text-white bg-slate-900 min-h-screen">
      <h1 className="text-3xl font-bold mb-4">🌲 Chop Tree Idle Demo</h1>
      <p className="mb-2 text-lg">You have {wood} wood.</p>
      <button
        onClick={chopTree}
        className="bg-green-600 px-4 py-2 rounded-xl hover:bg-green-500 transition"
      >
        Chop Tree
      </button>
      <p className="mt-6 text-sm opacity-70">Close the tab and come back later!</p>
    </div>
  );
}
```

### Playable demo

<IdleWelcomeDemo />

### Why localStorage is not secure

This version works fine for learning, but it’s easy to cheat.
Anyone can open DevTools and set their last active timestamp to zero:

```js
localStorage.setItem('lastActive', '0');
```

---

### Making it secure with Supabase

In a real setup, the server should track time and handle calculations.
That way, you can’t trick the system by editing local data or your computer clock.

| Column           | Type        | Description                            |
| ---------------- | ----------- | -------------------------------------- |
| id               | uuid        | Player ID                              |
| wood             | int         | Total wood collected                   |
| last_active      | timestamptz | Last seen time                         |
| last_login_bonus | timestamptz | When the last offline reward was given |

Here’s what the server-side logic could look like:

```ts
import { supabase } from '../lib/supabase';

async function getOfflineEarnings(userId: string) {
  const { data } = await supabase.from('profiles').select('*').eq('id', userId).single();
  const now = new Date();
  const lastActive = new Date(data.last_active);

  const diffMs = now.getTime() - lastActive.getTime();
  const diffMinutes = diffMs / 60000;
  const cappedMinutes = Math.min(diffMinutes, 480); // 8-hour cap
  const earned = Math.floor(cappedMinutes * 1); // 1 wood/min

  await supabase
    .from('profiles')
    .update({
      wood: data.wood + earned,
      last_active: now.toISOString(),
    })
    .eq('id', userId);

  return earned;
}
```

When the player opens the game again, call this function and show the message:

```js
alert(`🌲 Welcome back! You earned ${earned} wood while you were away.`);
```

### Small anti-cheat improvements

Even with server validation, add some extra safety checks:

- Always clamp offline duration to 8 hours.
- Apply the offline reward only once per session.
- Prevent multiple quick reloads from stacking rewards.
- Calculate rewards entirely on the server.

These checks stop most casual cheats before they start.

### Making it feel rewarding

The math is one thing, but presentation makes the difference.

Try adding:

- A smooth popup animation for “Welcome Back”.
- A counter animation as wood increases.
- A soft sound or sparkle when showing rewards.

It’s a small feature that gives your idle game personality.
Players love feeling like their world kept moving without them.

Wrapping up

What we built:

- A working “Welcome Back” system in React.
- A local version for demo purposes.
- A secure Supabase-based approach for production.

This pattern is used in every idle game — from chopping trees to mining gold to farming crops.
It’s the mechanic that keeps players coming back.

Next, we’ll explore how to save player progress safely and sync it between sessions.
