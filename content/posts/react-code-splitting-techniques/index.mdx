React is a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces, but with growing application sizes, the JavaScript bundle size can become large, leading to slow load times and poor performance. To mitigate this problem, React provides several code-splitting techniques that allow you to split your code into smaller chunks, reducing the initial JavaScript bundle's size and improving your application's performance.

In this blog post, we'll cover the following code-splitting techniques for React:

- Dynamic Imports
- React Lazy
- Loadable Components
- Advanced Techniques:
  - Route-based code splitting
  - Preloading
  - Inlining critical CSS
  - Dynamic chunks

```js
import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';

const MyComponent = () => {
  const [module, setModule] = useState(null);

  useEffect(() => {
    import('./MyWidget').then((mod) => setModule(mod.default));
  }, []);

  return module ? <module /> : <div>Loading...</div>;
};
```

### React Lazy with Suspense

[React Lazy](https://reactjs.org/docs/code-splitting.html#reactlazy) is a higher-order component that allows you to load components lazily, i.e., on-demand when they are needed. With React Lazy, you can ensure that your application only loads the elements it needs, reducing the size of the initial JavaScript bundle and improving performance.

```js
import React, { lazy, Suspense } from 'react';

const MyComponent = lazy(() => import('./MyComponent'));

const App = () => (
  <Suspense fallback={<div>Loading...</div>}>
    <MyComponent />
  </Suspense>
);
```

### Loadable Components

[Loadable Components](https://loadable-components.com/) is a higher-order component that allows you to split your
code into smaller chunks and load them on demand, just like React Lazy. With Loadable Components, you
can specify a loading component displayed while the code chunk is being loaded.

```js
import React from 'react';
import loadable from '@loadable/component';

const MyComponent = loadable(() => import('./MyComponent'), {
  fallback: <div>Loading...</div>,
});

const App = () => <MyComponent />;
```

### Advanced Techniques

In addition to dynamic imports, React Lazy, and Loadable Components, there are several advanced code-splitting techniques that you can use to optimise the performance of your React applications further.

#### Route-based code splitting

Route-based code splitting involves splitting your code into chunks based on the routes in your application. With route-based code splitting, you can ensure that only the code required for a particular route is loaded, leading to smaller initial JavaScript bundles and improved performance.

#### Preloading

Preloading is a technique where you can load code chunks in the background while the user interacts with the application. This ensures that the code chunks are loaded before they are needed, reducing the time taken to load them and improving the overall performance of your application.

#### Inlining critical CSS

Inlining critical CSS involves including the styles required for the initial view of a page in the HTML file itself rather than loading them from a separate CSS file. This reduces the time taken to load the styles and improves the performance of your application.

#### Dynamic chunks

Dynamic chunks allow you to split your code into smaller chunks and load them on demand, just like dynamic imports and React Lazy. The difference is that with dynamic chunks, you can specify the chunk name and the file name, giving you more control over the code-splitting process.

That's it; the post covers all the latest React code-splitting techniques and provides code examples to help you implement them in your React applications. With these techniques, you can ensure that your React applications are fast and performant, delivering a great user experience to your users.
