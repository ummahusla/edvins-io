As your React app grows in complexity, managing state with `useState` hooks can become challenging to maintain. That's where `useReducer` comes in – a React hook that can help organise complex state logic, enable better separation of concerns and make testing easier. In this blog post, we'll walk through the process of refactoring from `useState` to `useReducer` in React, using some concrete code examples (Counter and Shopping Cart) to illustrate the process.

---

### What is useReducer?

`useReducer` is a React hook that lets you manage the state using a reducer function. A reducer function is a pure function that takes the current state and an action and returns the new state. It is a way of encapsulating state updates into a single function. Here's an example:

```jsx
const initialState = { count: 0 };

function reducer(state, action) {
  switch (action.type) {
    case 'INCREMENT':
      return { count: state.count + 1 };
    case 'DECREMENT':
      return { count: state.count - 1 };
    default:
      throw new Error();
  }
}

function Counter() {
  const [state, dispatch] = useReducer(reducer, initialState);

  return (
    <div>
      Count: {state.count}
      <button onClick={() => dispatch({ type: 'INCREMENT' })}>+</button>
      <button onClick={() => dispatch({ type: 'DECREMENT' })}>-</button>
    </div>
  );
}
```

In this example, we've defined an initial state with a `count` of `0` and a reducer function that handles two actions: `increment` and `decrement`. We then use `useReducer` to initialise our state and dispatch function and use them to update the state when the user clicks on the `+` or `-` buttons.

### Advantages of useReducer

Okay, now we know what `useReducer` does, but why do we want to use `useReducer` over `useState`? There are several advantages:

- Better organisation — `useReducer` lets you organise complex state logic into a single reducer function, making it easier to reason about and maintain.
- Separation of concerns — by encapsulating state updates into a single function, `useReducer` can help separate concerns and reduce coupling between components.
- Better testing — since reducer functions are pure, testing them in isolation is easy.
- Performance optimisation — by reducing the number of re-renders. This is because `useReducer` allows you to pass down `state` and `dispatch` functions through context, avoiding prop drilling.

---

### Disadvantages of useReducer

Despite the advantages of `useReducer`, there are also some disadvantages too.

- More verbose — Using `useReducer` often requires more code than using `useState`, especially when dealing with simple state updates. This can make your code harder to read and maintain.
- Steep learning curve — The `useReducer` hook can be more challenging to understand and use effectively than `useState`. It requires a fundamental understanding of the reducer pattern, which may only be familiar to some developers.
- More boilerplate — when using `useReducer`, you must define an action type for every possible state change, which can be tedious and error-prone.
- Less flexible — `useReducer` is a more rigid solution than `useState`. It's best suited for managing complex state changes involving multiple data pieces but may need more than simple state updates.
- Requires more planning — as `useReducer` requires a separate action type for each state update, you need to plan out your state management carefully before implementing it. This can make it more time-consuming to set up than `useState`.

### Refactoring process

Now that we understand the basics of `useReducer` let's walk through the basic process of refactoring from `useState` to `useReducer`. Here's a simple example to get us started:

```jsx
import React, { useState } from 'react';

function Counter() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  function handleIncrement() {
    setCount(count + 1);
  }

  function handleDecrement() {
    setCount(count - 1);
  }

  return (
    <div>
      Count: {count}
      <button onClick={handleIncrement}>+</button>
      <button onClick={handleDecrement}>-</button>
    </div>
  );
}
```

In this example, we have a simple `Counter` component that uses `useState` to manage the `count` state. When the user clicks the `+` or `-` buttons, we update the state with `setCount`.

To refactor this to `useReducer`, we need to define a reducer function and an initial state. Here's what the refactored code looks like:

```jsx {3,5-14,17,20,24}
import React, { useReducer } from 'react';

const initialState = { count: 0 };

function reducer(state, action) {
  switch (action.type) {
    case 'INCREMENT':
      return { count: state.count + 1 };
    case 'DECREMENT':
      return { count: state.count - 1 };
    default:
      throw new Error();
  }
}

function Counter() {
  const [state, dispatch] = useReducer(reducer, initialState);

  function handleIncrement() {
    dispatch({ type: 'INCREMENT' });
  }

  function handleDecrement() {
    dispatch({ type: 'DECREMENT' });
  }

  return (
    <div>
      Count: {state.count}
      <button onClick={handleIncrement}>+</button>
      <button onClick={handleDecrement}>-</button>
    </div>
  );
}
```

In this refactored code, we've defined an initial state object `{ count: 0 }`, and a reducer function that handles two actions `increment` and `decrement`. We then use `useReducer` to initialise our state and dispatch function and use them to update the state when the user clicks on the `+` or `-` buttons.

Note that we've replaced the `setCount` call with a `dispatch` call that passes an object with a `type` property of `'increment'`. This object represents the action we want to perform on our state. The `reducer` function then handles this action and returns the new state object.

### Advanced example

Whilst `Counter` is a simple example which provides enough to understand in general how `useReducer` works. Let's look at `ShoppingCart` as a more complex example to see how `useReducer` can help us organise complex state logic.

Here's a simple shopping cart component that uses `useState` to manage the state:

```jsx
import React, { useRef, useState } from 'react';

function ShoppingCart() {
  const itemId = useRef(0);

  const [cart, setCart] = useState({
    items: [],
    total: 0,
  });

  function handleAddItem(item) {
    itemId.current += 1;

    setCart({
      items: [
        ...cart.items,
        {
          id: itemId.current,
          ...item,
        },
      ],
      total: cart.total + item.price,
    });
  }

  function handleRemoveItem(item) {
    setCart({
      items: cart.items.filter((i) => i.id !== item.id),
      total: cart.total - item.price,
    });
  }

  function handleClearCart() {
    setCart({
      items: [],
      total: 0,
    });
  }

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Shopping Cart</h1>
      <ul>
        {cart.items.map((item) => (
          <li key={item.id}>
            {item.name} - ${item.price}
            <button onClick={() => handleRemoveItem(item)}>-</button>
          </li>
        ))}
      </ul>
      <p>Total: ${cart.total}</p>
      <button onClick={() => handleAddItem({ name: 'Apple', price: 1 })}>Add Apple</button>
      <button onClick={() => handleAddItem({ name: 'Orange', price: 2 })}>Add Orange</button>
      <button onClick={() => handleClearCart()}>Clear cart</button>
    </div>
  );
}
```

In this example, we have a `ShoppingCart` component that uses `useState` to manage the `cart` state. The `cart` state is an object with two properties: `items` and `total`. The `items` property is an array of items in the cart, and the `total` property is the total price of all the items in the cart. When the user clicks the `+` or `-` buttons, we update the state with `setCart`.

In order to prevent issue with duplicate `id` values, we use a `useRef` hook to keep track of the current `id` value and increment it each time we add a new item to the cart.

To refactor this to `useReducer`, same here as in the previous example we need to define a reducer function and an initial state. Here's what the refactored code looks like:

```jsx {3-6,8-25,30,35-40,45,49}
import React, { useReducer } from 'react';

const initialState = {
  items: [],
  total: 0,
};

function reducer(state, action) {
  switch (action.type) {
    case 'ADD_ITEM':
      return {
        items: [...state.items, action.payload],
        total: state.total + action.payload.price,
      };
    case 'REMOVE_ITEM':
      return {
        items: state.items.filter((item) => item.id !== action.payload.id),
        total: state.total - action.payload.price,
      };
    case 'CLEAR_CART':
      return initialState;
    default:
      return state;
  }
}

function ShoppingCart() {
  const itemId = useRef(0);

  const [state, dispatch] = useReducer(reducer, initialState);

  function handleAddItem(item) {
    itemId.current += 1;

    dispatch({
      type: 'ADD_ITEM',
      payload: {
        id: itemId.current,
        ...item,
      },
    });
  }

  function handleRemoveItem(item) {
    dispatch({ type: 'REMOVE_ITEM', payload: item });
  }

  function handleClearCart() {
    dispatch({ type: 'CLEAR_CART' });
  }

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Shopping Cart</h1>
      <ul>
        {state.items.map((item) => (
          <li key={item.id}>
            {item.name} - ${item.price}
            <button onClick={() => handleRemoveItem(item)}>-</button>
          </li>
        ))}
      </ul>
      <p>Total: ${state.total}</p>
      <button onClick={() => handleAddItem({ name: 'Apple', price: 1 })}>Add Apple</button>
      <button onClick={() => handleAddItem({ name: 'Orange', price: 2 })}>Add Orange</button>
      <button onClick={() => handleClearCart()}>Clear cart</button>
    </div>
  );
}
```

### Conclusion

Refactoring from `useState` to `useReducer` can be a great way to organise complex state logic in your React app. By encapsulating state updates into a single reducer function, you can make your code more maintainable, easier to test, and more scalable. In this blog post, we've walked through the process of refactoring a simple `Counter` component from `useState` to `useReducer`, and provided some concrete code examples to illustrate the process.

I hope you found this helpful because I recently refactored a big chunk of the code for one of the side projects I was working on. I reduced the number of re-renders from 20 to 2, a considerable performance boost for the app. The code was much easier to understand and maintain, and it was much easier to test the reducer functions in isolation.
