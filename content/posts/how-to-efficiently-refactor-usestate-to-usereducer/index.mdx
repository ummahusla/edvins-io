As your React app grows in complexity, managing state with `useState` hooks can become challenging to maintain. That's where `useReducer` comes in – a React hook that can help organise complex state logic, enable better separation of concerns and make testing easier. In this blog post, we'll walk through the process of refactoring from `useState` to `useReducer` in React, using some concrete code examples (Counter and Shopping Cart) to illustrate the process.

### What is useReducer?

`useReducer` is a React hook that lets you manage the state using a reducer function. A reducer function is a pure function that takes the current state and an action and returns the new state. It is a way of encapsulating state updates into a single function. Here's an example:

<iframe
  src="https://codesandbox.io/embed/counter-usereducer-8fbviw?fontsize=14&hidenavigation=1&module=%2Fsrc%2FCounter.js"
  style={{ width: '100%', height: '500px', border: 0, borderRadius: '4px', overflow: 'hidden' }}
  title="Counter (useReducer)"
  allow="accelerometer; ambient-light-sensor; camera; encrypted-media; geolocation; gyroscope; hid; microphone; midi; payment; usb; vr; xr-spatial-tracking"
  sandbox="allow-forms allow-modals allow-popups allow-presentation allow-same-origin allow-scripts"
></iframe>

In this example, we've defined an initial state with a `count` of `0` and a reducer function that handles two actions: `increment` and `decrement`. We then use `useReducer` to initialise our state and dispatch function and use them to update the state when the user clicks on the `+` or `-` buttons.

### Advantages of useReducer

Okay, now we know what `useReducer` does, but why do we want to use `useReducer` over `useState`? There are several advantages:

- Better organisation — `useReducer` lets you organise complex state logic into a single reducer function, making it easier to reason about and maintain.
- Separation of concerns — by encapsulating state updates into a single function, `useReducer` can help separate concerns and reduce coupling between components.
- Better testing — since reducer functions are pure, testing them in isolation is easy.
- Performance optimisation — by reducing the number of re-renders. This is because `useReducer` allows you to pass down `state` and `dispatch` functions through context, avoiding prop drilling.

### Disadvantages of useReducer

Despite the advantages of `useReducer`, there are also some disadvantages too.

- More verbose — Using `useReducer` often requires more code than using `useState`, especially when dealing with simple state updates. This can make your code harder to read and maintain.
- Steep learning curve — The `useReducer` hook can be more challenging to understand and use effectively than `useState`. It requires a fundamental understanding of the reducer pattern, which may only be familiar to some developers.
- More boilerplate — when using `useReducer`, you must define an action type for every possible state change, which can be tedious and error-prone.
- Less flexible — `useReducer` is a more rigid solution than `useState`. It's best suited for managing complex state changes involving multiple data pieces but may need more than simple state updates.
- Requires more planning — as `useReducer` requires a separate action type for each state update, you need to plan out your state management carefully before implementing it. This can make it more time-consuming to set up than `useState`.

### Refactoring process

Now that we understand the basics of `useReducer` let's walk through the basic process of refactoring from `useState` to `useReducer`. Here's a simple example to get us started:

<iframe
  src="https://codesandbox.io/embed/winter-breeze-tbm6h9?fontsize=14&hidenavigation=1&module=%2Fsrc%2FCounter.js"
  style={{ width: '100%', height: '500px', border: 0, borderRadius: '4px', overflow: 'hidden' }}
  title="Counter (useState)"
  allow="accelerometer; ambient-light-sensor; camera; encrypted-media; geolocation; gyroscope; hid; microphone; midi; payment; usb; vr; xr-spatial-tracking"
  sandbox="allow-forms allow-modals allow-popups allow-presentation allow-same-origin allow-scripts"
></iframe>

In this example, we have a simple `Counter` component that uses `useState` to manage the `count` state. When the user clicks the `+` or `-` buttons, we update the state with `setCount`.

To refactor this to `useReducer`, we need to define a reducer function and an initial state. Here's what the refactored code looks like:

<iframe
  src="https://codesandbox.io/embed/counter-usereducer-8fbviw?fontsize=14&hidenavigation=1&module=%2Fsrc%2FCounter.js"
  style={{ width: '100%', height: '500px', border: 0, borderRadius: '4px', overflow: 'hidden' }}
  title="Counter (useReducer)"
  allow="accelerometer; ambient-light-sensor; camera; encrypted-media; geolocation; gyroscope; hid; microphone; midi; payment; usb; vr; xr-spatial-tracking"
  sandbox="allow-forms allow-modals allow-popups allow-presentation allow-same-origin allow-scripts"
></iframe>

In this refactored code, we've defined an initial state object `{ count: 0 }`, and a reducer function that handles two actions `INCREMENT` and `DECREMENT`. We then use `useReducer` to initialise our state and dispatch function and use them to update the state when the user clicks on the `+` or `-` buttons.

Note that we've replaced the `setCount` call with a `dispatch` call that passes an object with a `type` property of `'INCREMENT'`. This object represents the action we want to perform on our state. The `reducer` function then handles this action and returns the new state object.

### Advanced example

Whilst `Counter` is a simple example which provides enough to understand in general how `useReducer` works. Let's look at `ShoppingCart` as a more complex example to see how `useReducer` can help us organise complex state logic.

Here's a simple shopping cart component that uses `useState` to manage the state:

<iframe
  src="https://codesandbox.io/embed/shopping-cart-usestate-30ijcq?fontsize=14&hidenavigation=1&module=%2Fsrc%2FShoppingCart.js&theme=dark"
  style={{ width: '100%', height: '500px', border: 0, borderRadius: '4px', overflow: 'hidden' }}
  title="Shopping Cart (useState)"
  allow="accelerometer; ambient-light-sensor; camera; encrypted-media; geolocation; gyroscope; hid; microphone; midi; payment; usb; vr; xr-spatial-tracking"
  sandbox="allow-forms allow-modals allow-popups allow-presentation allow-same-origin allow-scripts"
></iframe>

In this example, we have a `ShoppingCart` component that uses `useState` to manage the `cart` state. The `cart` state is an object with two properties: `items` and `total`. The `items` property is an array of items in the cart, and the `total` property is the total price of all the items in the cart. When the user clicks the `+` or `-` buttons, we update the state with `setCart`.

In order to prevent issue with duplicate `id` values, we use a `useRef` hook to keep track of the current `id` value and increment it each time we add a new item to the cart.

To refactor this to `useReducer`, same here as in the previous example we need to define a reducer function and an initial state. Here's what the refactored code looks like:

<iframe
  src="https://codesandbox.io/embed/shopping-cart-usereducer-pge9m9?fontsize=14&hidenavigation=1&module=%2Fsrc%2FShoppingCart.js&theme=dark"
  style={{ width: '100%', height: '500px', border: 0, borderRadius: '4px', overflow: 'hidden' }}
  title="Shopping Cart (useReducer)"
  allow="accelerometer; ambient-light-sensor; camera; encrypted-media; geolocation; gyroscope; hid; microphone; midi; payment; usb; vr; xr-spatial-tracking"
  sandbox="allow-forms allow-modals allow-popups allow-presentation allow-same-origin allow-scripts"
></iframe>

### Conclusion

Refactoring from `useState` to `useReducer` can be a great way to organise complex state logic in your React app. By encapsulating state updates into a single reducer function, you can make your code more maintainable, easier to test, and more scalable. In this blog post, we've walked through the process of refactoring a simple `Counter` component from `useState` to `useReducer`, and provided some concrete code examples to illustrate the process.

I hope you found this helpful because I recently refactored a big chunk of the code for one of the side projects I was working on. I reduced the number of re-renders from 10 to 2, a considerable performance boost for the app. The code was much easier to understand and maintain, and it was much easier to test the reducer functions in isolation.
