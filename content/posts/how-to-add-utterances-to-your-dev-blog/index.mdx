I have constantly been debating whether I need a comment system. Previously, I've been a WordPress user for many years and always had comments turned on. Since I moved from WordPress ~2 years ago and built this blog using GatsbyJS, I decided not to have any comments. Maybe I was fed up with constant bots which were spamming me.

I also had previous experience with the Disqus comment system, but I'm not a big fan of ads and wanted a lightweight solution for my static website. I also didn't want to implement a comment system for myself, it could be an excellent option to use it as a learning experience to code and write about it, but sadly I only have a little time for this.

As time passed, my writing list became more prominent, and more people were trying to reach me. That's when I started thinking I needed a comment system.

In the past few years, I have seen many technical blogs adopting [utterances](https://utteranc.es/) as a comment system. Utterances built on the GitHub Issues means that all data is stored at GitHub. Additionally, it's free and open-source, and there is no tracking or ads. Moreover, everyone except my wife or mom, who reads my blog, is probably a developer or future developer and has a GitHub account to leave a comment.

### How Utterances works

> When Utterances loads, the GitHub issue searches API to find the issue associated with the page based on `url`, `pathname` or `title`. If it cannot find an issue that matches the page, no problem, `utterances-bot` will automatically create an issue the first time someone comments.

### Setup

The whole setup took me roughly 10 minutes to do.

I've gone through the [configuration](https://utteranc.es/) section to understand how it works.

Then I searched for existing npm packages and selected the most downloaded/up-to-date one -`utterances-react`.

Then created a new `Comments` component file and used the `utterances-react` package example code. I changed a few settings like `repo`, but then I realised I have a dark mode switch on my website. Therefore I want my comment box to adapt to the select colour mode. I use `theme-ui`, so I extracted the `colorMode` from the `useColorMode()` hook and used it to determine the currently active theme.

```jsx:title=comments.js {2,5-16}
const Comments = () => {
  const [colorMode] = useColorMode();

  return (
    <Utterances
      repo="ummahusla/edvins-io"
      issueTerm="pathname"
      theme={colorMode === 'dark' ? 'github-dark' : 'github-light'}
      crossorigin="anonymous"
      async={false}
      style={`
      & .utterances {
        max-width: 950px;
      }
    `}
    />
  );
};
```

The last step is to use `<Comments />` where we want to display that comment section. In my case, it's the bottom of the`post.js` file.

```jsx:title=post.js {9}
const Post = (...) => {
  return (
    <Layout>
      ...
      <section>
        <MDXRenderer>{post.body}</MDXRenderer>
      </section>
      <section>
        <Comments />
      </section>
      ...
    </Layout>
  );
};
```
