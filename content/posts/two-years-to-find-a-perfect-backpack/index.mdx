It took me nearly two years to find a perfect replacement for my [Slotra 15.6" Slim Anti-Theft Laptop Backpack](https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B01DKLOOLG) which I got from Amazon back in 2017. I figured out a list of things I want to have in my new backpack — multi-functional, spacious and water-resistant. I really wanted to have one multi-purpose backpack for commute, travelling and hiking, yet my old one was only suitable for the commute. Moreover, my old backpack was super slim, that it was a challenge to fit a MacBook, charger, headphones and a lunch box in it.

I've made massive research about backpacks and spoke to my friends and colleagues to get their recommendations. Many people were suggesting to go for [Herschel Little America backpack](https://herschel.eu/shop/backpacks/herschel-little-america-backpack) for its spacious design and product quality. I've read many great reviews about it and seen that's very popular among the developers. I was working remotely before the COVID-19 pandemic hit, so I was travelling only a few times per month. I had all the time in the world to make this decision and that's probably the only reason why I haven't bought a Herschel backpack yet.

I was watching Mr. Robot, when suddenly, Elliot's assault backpack got my attention. I knew nothing about assault backpacks. Luckily enough, I wasn't alone — I found a discussion on [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/MrRobot/comments/3c2v4u/what_backpack_is_elliott_wearing/). I haven't found a definite answer but most people believed it is — 3V Gear Velox II Tactical Assault Pack.

I also noticed in this Reddit post that someone mentioned [Mil-Tec Military Army Patrol Molle Assault Pack](https://www.military1st.co.uk/14002202-mil-tec-molle-us-assault-pack-large-black.html), to me it looked a perfect match. The decision was finally made.

Fast forward to today, I've been using Mil-Tech Molle Assault Pack for 2 months now. Honestly, it's exactly what I wanted it to be. Thanks to Mr. Robot tv series for inspiration, as it fulfilled all of my requirements — and I've tested it on multiple occasions like commute and travel. When a nationwide lockdown is over, I plan to go hiking and take this backpack with me, so I might update this blog post with my results.
