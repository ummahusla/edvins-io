My approach solving [HackerRankâ€™s Lonely Integer](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/lonely-integer/problem) code challenge.

---

### Problem

Given an array of integers, where all elements but one occur twice, find the unique element.

### Example

`a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 3, 2, 1]`

The unique element is `4`.

### Input format

The first line contains a single integer, `n`, the number of integers in the array.

The second line contains `n` space-separated integers that describe the values in `a`.

### Returns

Returns `int` value of the element that occurs only once.

### Solution

First, we start by creating a `count` function which accepts the value (`v`) we want to search for. Within the function, we run the `Array.filter()` method to create a new copy of a given array and populate it with the filtered value(s) (`v`). Then `Array.length` returns the exact number of times the value (`v`) appeared in the given array.

After that, we run a classic `for` loop where within each iteration, we pass the current array's item to the `count()` function and see if the result is equal to `1`. If so, we return the current value (`arr[i]`) as it is unique and appears only once.

```js
function lonelyinteger(a) {
  const count = (v) => a.filter((i) => i == v).length;

  for (let i = 0; i < a.length; i++) {
    if (count(a[i]) === 1) {
      return a[i];
    }
  }
}
```
