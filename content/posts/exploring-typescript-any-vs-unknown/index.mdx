In TypeScript, both `any` and `unknown` are used to handle values of unknown or dynamic types, but they serve different purposes and come with varying levels of type safety. It is also a popular TypeScript interview question, the answer for which is worth knowing.

---

### any

`any` is the most permissive type in TypeScript. It effectively turns off type checking for a variable or value, allowing you to assign and access it in any way you want without type errors.

It is often used when you don't know or don't want to specify the variable type or when working with dynamic data that doesn't have a consistent type.

While `any` provides much flexibility, it sacrifices type safety because you can perform operations on `any` value that might not make sense, and TypeScript won't catch these errors.

```ts
let x: any = 10;
x = 'Hello'; // No type error
x.foo(); // No type error, but it might fail at runtime
```

### unknown

`unknown` is a safer alternative to any. It represents a value whose type is not known at compile time, similar to any, but with stricter type checking.
You cannot perform arbitrary operations on an unknown value. You must first assert or narrow down its type before working with it.
Using unknown forces you to be explicit about handling type conversions, making your code more predictable and safer.

```ts
let y: unknown = 10;
y = 'Hello'; // This is allowed

if (typeof y === 'string') {
  console.log(y.toUpperCase()); // OK, type narrowed to string
}
```

In summary, I prefer using `unknown` over `any` when dealing with values of unknown types, as it provides better type safety by requiring explicit type checks and conversions. Only use `any` when working with legacy code or situations where strict typing is not feasible or practical. Using `unknown` encourages more type-safe code and better compatibility with TypeScript's type system.
