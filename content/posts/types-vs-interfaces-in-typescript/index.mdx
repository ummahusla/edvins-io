Types and interfaces are two essential features of TypeScript that let you define the structure and shape of your data. They help ensure your code works with the correct data types and make your code easier to understand. While they look similar, there are some key differences you should know about.

---

## What are Interfaces?

Interfaces define the structure of an object. They specify what properties and methods an object must have. Interfaces are great for describing the shape of an object and are often used to define contracts for objects in your codebase.

## What are Types?

Types in TypeScript are more flexible. They can be used for more than just defining object shapes. You can use them to define variables, classes, functions, arrays, unions, and more. Types let you give a name to any type and can be used wherever a type is needed.

## Quick comparison

Here's a table showing the main differences:

| Feature | Interface | Type |
|---------|-----------|------|
| Define object shape | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes |
| Extend/inherit | ✅ Yes (using `extends`) | ✅ Yes (using `&`) |
| Merge declarations | ✅ Yes | ❌ No |
| Union types | ❌ No | ✅ Yes |
| Primitive types | ❌ No | ✅ Yes |
| Tuples | ❌ No | ✅ Yes |
| Computed properties | ❌ Limited | ✅ Yes |

## Example

Here's an example that shows the difference:

```typescript
interface Point {
  x: number;
  y: number;
}

type Tuple = [number, number];

let point: Point = { x: 0, y: 0 };
let tuple: Tuple = [0, 0];

console.log(point); // Output: { x: 0, y: 0 }
console.log(tuple); // Output: [0, 0]
```

Here, `Point` is an interface that describes an object with two properties, `x` and `y`, both of type `number`. `Tuple` is a type that represents a tuple of two numbers. While both `point` and `tuple` have similar values, they have different types.

---

## Extending and merging

Interfaces can be extended, meaning you can create new interfaces that inherit properties from existing ones:

```typescript
interface Animal {
  name: string;
}

interface Dog extends Animal {
  breed: string;
}

const myDog: Dog = { name: "Buddy", breed: "Golden Retriever" };
```

Types can be combined using intersections:

```typescript
type Animal = {
  name: string;
};

type Dog = Animal & {
  breed: string;
};

const myDog: Dog = { name: "Buddy", breed: "Golden Retriever" };
```

One unique feature of interfaces is declaration merging. If you declare the same interface twice, TypeScript will merge them:

```typescript
interface User {
  name: string;
}

interface User {
  age: number;
}

// User now has both name and age
const user: User = { name: "John", age: 30 };
```

---

## When to use which?

**Use interfaces when:**
- Defining object shapes or class contracts
- You need declaration merging
- Working with object-oriented programming patterns

**Use types when:**
- Creating union or intersection types
- Defining tuples or primitive types
- Working with complex type transformations
- You need computed properties

In most cases, you can use either one for object shapes. Pick one and stay consistent in your codebase!.
