My approach solving [HackerRankâ€™s Find the Median](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/find-the-median/problem) code challenge.

---

### Problem

The median of a list of numbers is essentially its middle element after sorting. The same number of elements occur after it as before. Given a list of numbers with an odd number of elements, find the median?

### Example

`arr = [5, 3, 1, 2, 4]`

The sorted array `arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`. The middle element and the median is `3`.

### Input format

The first line contains the integer `n`, the size of `arr`.

The second line contains `n` space-separated integers `arr[i]`.

### Returns

`int`: the median of the array.

### Sample input

```
7
0 1 2 4 6 5 3
```

### Sample output

```
3
```

### Solution

We start by sorting our given array in ascending order and saving the results as a sorted array (`strArr`) variable.

After that, we find the array's middle point by dividing the array's length by `2` and using `Math.floor()` to round up the number.

Then we check to see if the array's length is even or odd and return the results based on the evaluation.

```js
function findMedian(arr) {
  const srtArr = arr.sort((a, b) => a - b);
  const mid = Math.floor(srtArr.length / 2);

  if (srtArr.length % 2 === 0) {
    return (srtArr[mid - 1] + srtArr[mid]) / 2;
  }

  return srtArr[mid];
}
```
