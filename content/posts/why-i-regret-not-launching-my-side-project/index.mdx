title: Why I regret not launching my side project

One of my biggest regrets is letting a side project stay just that—a side project. Four years back, I had an idea for an app called Cultivate, designed to help people build lasting habits. It was a fully functional, full-stack application: an intuitive habit tracker that could keep people on track without overcomplicating things. I’d mapped out the features, user flows, and even designed a UI I thought people would love. But I never launched it.

Why? Honestly, a mix of timing, doubt, and the never-ending pursuit of “perfect.” I kept telling myself that I’d get back to it, that it needed just one more tweak or improvement. Weeks turned into months, and eventually, Cultivate faded into the background. The irony? Now more than ever, I see the demand for tools that help people stay consistent and motivated with their habits. And with everything I know now, I can’t help but think: Cultivate might have been that tool.

Looking back, the lesson is clear: the power of getting things out there, even if they’re not perfect, can’t be underestimated. Cultivate was a fully functional app that I put a lot of heart into, and it’s still something I’m proud of. You can see it in action in the video below.

That experience actually pushed me to launch another side project, and this time, I didn’t hold back. I put it out there, iterated based on feedback, and even managed to turn it into something profitable.

So if you’re working on something on the side, even if it feels unfinished, don’t let it gather dust. Perfect can wait; launch it anyway. You never know where it might lead.
