Stack is a popular data structure in computer science which is commonly used in various applications, such as evaluating mathematical expressions and managing memory allocation. A stack is a data structure that follows the last-in-first-out (LIFO) principle, meaning that the last item added to the stack will be the first item to be removed. An array-based Stack data structure organises data in a specific order, where items can only be added or removed from the top of the stack.

In JavaScript, implementing an array-based stack is straightforward and can be done using the built-in array methods.

> Initially, I encountered this popular code challenge while preparing for front-end interviews on [GreatFrontEnd](https://www.greatfrontend.com/?fpr=edvins).

To create a stack, we create a `Stack` class with a constructor method that initialises an empty array, which will store the items in the stack. The class has the following class methods:

- `push`: adds an item to the top of the stack. It takes in a value as an argument and then uses the array's push method to add the value to the end of the array.
- `pop`: removes the top item from the stack. It uses the array's pop method to remove the last item from the array and then returns the removed value.
- `peek`: returns the top item from the stack without removing it. It uses the array's length property to access the last item in the array and then returns it.
- `isEmpty`: checks if the stack is empty. It returns a boolean value based on whether the array is empty.
- `length`: returns the number of items in the stack.

Here's an example of how to implement an array-based stack in JavaScript:

```js
class Stack {
  constructor() {
    this.items = [];
  }

  push(item) {
    return this.items.push(item);
  }

  pop() {
    return this.items.pop();
  }

  isEmpty() {
    return this.items.length === 0;
  }

  peek() {
    return this.items[this.items.length - 1];
  }

  length() {
    return this.items.length;
  }
}
```
