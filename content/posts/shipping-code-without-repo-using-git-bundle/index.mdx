# Shipping code without a repo using git bundle

Most Git workflows assume you have a remote repository. GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket – pick one. But Git doesn't actually need a server at all.

`git bundle` lets you package a repository (including full history) into a single file that can be cloned later. No remote. No credentials. No public repo.

I've been using this more often than I expected.

---

## tl;dr

- `git bundle` creates a portable Git archive
- The bundle contains full commit history
- You can clone it like a normal repo
- Great for private tasks, interviews, audits, or offline work

---

## The problem

Sometimes you want to share code, but you don't want to:

- Create a public GitHub repo
- Invite someone to a private repo
- Set up access tokens
- Expose unfinished or throwaway work

Common use cases:

- Sending a take-home task to a candidate
- Submitting a coding assignment without publishing it
- Sharing internal tooling with a contractor
- Archiving a repo for long-term storage
- Working in restricted or offline environments

Git already solves this. It's just not a common workflow.

---

## Creating a bundle

From inside your repo:

```bash
git bundle create task.bundle --all
```

That's it.

This creates a single file called `task.bundle` containing:

- All commits
- All branches
- All tags
- Full history

You can scope it if you want:

```bash
git bundle create task.bundle main
```

Or only a range:

```bash
git bundle create task.bundle main ^v1.0.0
```

The bundle is just a file. Zip it, email it, drop it in Slack, upload it anywhere.

---

## Cloning from a bundle

On the receiving side:

```bash
git clone task.bundle my-project
```

Git treats it like a remote. You get a normal working directory with history intact.

You can inspect it before cloning:

```bash
git bundle list-heads task.bundle
```

---

## Why this is useful

### Sending tech tasks

Instead of:

- Creating a repo
- Making it public or managing access
- Cleaning it up later

You can:

- Prepare the task locally
- Bundle it
- Send a single file

The candidate clones it, works normally, then sends back either:

- Another bundle
- A patch
- Or just the updated repo folder

No platform lock-in.

### Private code reviews

You can send a full history without pushing anywhere. Useful for:

- Audits
- Legal review
- Consulting work
- Pre-open-source cleanup

The reviewer gets real commits, not a ZIP of files.

### Offline work

Git bundles work without network access. This matters more than people think:

- Corporate environments
- Restricted networks
- Long-term backups
- Cold storage

A bundle is effectively a portable Git remote.

---

## Things to know

### Bundles are read-only by default

You can't push back into them, but you can create a new bundle in return.

### They can be large

Full history means full history. You can prune or limit refs if needed.

### They're deterministic

Same repo, same bundle hash. Useful for verification.

---

## Mental model

Think of `git bundle` as:

- `git clone`, but offline
- `git archive`, but with history
- A USB stick for Git

It's old Git functionality, but surprisingly underused.

---

## Wrapping up

If you ever find yourself creating a repo "just to share something once", try a bundle instead.

It's simpler, more private, and keeps Git doing what it was designed for: moving commits around, not managing platforms.

I now reach for `git bundle` anytime the question is "how do I send this repo to someone" rather than "where should I host this".
