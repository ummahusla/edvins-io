> Self-mastery is never ending work. It's a never-ending process of becoming more and more of who you are. - [Eckhart Tolle](https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/4493.Eckhart_Tolle)

I finished my formal degree back in 2014. Since then, I've spent countless hours programming, watching video courses, and reading books and articles. I spent most of my time on web and game development, management, business development and entrepreneurship.

### 2014 — 2020

It might take some time to gather information on things I've achieved between 2014 and 2020.

In general, I've used every opportunity and variety of resources like Codecademy, Coursera, Frontend Masters, Pluralsight, Udemy, Udacity, Egghead, Wes Bos courses, YouTube tutorials, books, etc to continue my personal growth.
