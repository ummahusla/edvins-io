<div style={{ fontSize:'22px' }}>I'm Edvins Antonovs — a front-end engineer and indie maker based in Riga, Latvia.</div>

I'm currently working at [Secondmind](https://secondmind.ai/), a Cambridge-based startup using machine learning to optimise decision-making in automotive engineering.

After hours, I work on various [side projects](/projects), explore new technologies, and [write about code](/blog). One of my recent projects is [Albion Online Grind](https://albiononlinegrind.com) — a tool that helps players improve their economy in the popular sandbox MMORPG, Albion Online. I also founded [Stealth Labs](https://www.stealthlabs.dev/) — a super professional and serious software development company.

I'm a passionate advocate of the ["learning in public"](https://www.swyx.io/learn-in-public/) movement and track my [learning journey](/self-education). I'm always looking for ways to improve my skills and knowledge, and I'm not afraid to share my experiences (even the failures) with the world.
