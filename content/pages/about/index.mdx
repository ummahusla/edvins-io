Hey, I'm Edvins! I'm a software developer located in Riga, Latvia. This website is my digital garden, where I tinker with things and share what I have learnt.

Check out the [projects page](/projects) to see a highlight of my work and the [blog](/blog) for my tutorials, [book notes](/blog/tags/books), and more.

I also adopted [learning in public](https://www.swyx.io/learn-in-public/) movement and started to track my [learning process](/self-education).

You can contact me by email at <strong>ummahusla at gmail.com</strong> to say hi! I always appreciate meeting new people.

### What

I work as a front-end engineer by the day and do a side hustle by night.

This year I have a list of [ambitious goals](/list-of-goals-for-2022) I want to achieve.

In the past, I've worked with startups like SEDNA, CyberOwl, and Purplebricks, companies like npower, British Gymnastics, and C.T.Co.

I've been freelancing, working on open-source and side projects since I started my career.

### Where

I've recently relocated to [Riga, Latvia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riga), after spending nearly ten years living in [Wolverhampton, UK](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolverhampton).

### Weird

When Iâ€™m not working, I love to [read](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/80549857-edvins-antonovs), [run](https://www.strava.com/athletes/29502472) and spend time with my family.

I'm obsessed with coffee and pizza.
