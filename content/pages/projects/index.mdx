I've always been building small projects to learn new technologies and improve my skills. During the start of my career, I was working as a freelancer and building small projects for clients through Upwork and Fiverr while I was still in university.

Over those years, I've built websites, web applications, mobile applications, desktop applications, Chrome extensions, npm packages, Telegram bots, and even games with Unity. Some of them are still in development, some are abandoned, and some are launched.

### 2023 — Present

### 2014 — 2023

One day I will make a detailed post about my projects and the lessons I've learned from them.
